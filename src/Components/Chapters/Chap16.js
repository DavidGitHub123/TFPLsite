    <h1 className='chapterHeading'>Chapter 16: Three Failed Conceptions of the Mormon New Jerusalem</h1>

    <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph Smith had three evolving conceptions of who would build Zion in Jackson County – none of which came to pass. We will go into the details of the three concepts later, but here’s a brief introduction.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>First Concept – The holy city of Zion would be built by the Lamanites, with the help of the converted Gentiles – Mormons. In the Book of Mormon, Christ prophesies that the Lamanites will recognize their identity as members of the House of Israel through Mormon missionary efforts. Then, the Lamanites will rise as a mighty force and build Zion. However, after the first Mormon missionary effort in 1831 to bring the Book of Mormon to the Lamanites failed, a new concept emerged of who would build Zion.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Second Concept – The holy city of Zion would be built by the Mormons. After the unsuccessful mission to the Lamanites in 1831, the concept of who would build Zion was reinterpreted.  Instead of Native Americans as its builders, contradictory to Christ’s prophecy, the New Jerusalem was now to be built by the Mormons.  During this time, Mormons began seeing themselves as the literal remnant of the House of Joseph through Ephraim, who would build the holy city.  Joseph Smith revealed, “Verily this is the word of the Lord, that the city New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints … even the place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>This clear reversal of prophecy remains a sore spot for the church. Mormon apostle Bruce McConkie stated, “An occasional whiff of nonsense goes around the church acclaiming that the Lamanites will build the temple in the New Jerusalem and that Ephraim and others will come to their assistance. This illusion is born of an inordinate love for Father Lehi’s children and of a desire to see them all become now as Samuel the Lamanite once was. The Book of Mormon passages upon which it is thought to rest have reference not to the Lamanites but to the whole House of Israel. The temple in Jackson County will be built by Ephraim, meaning the Church as it is now constituted.”

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In their attempts to build Zion, the Mormons were driven out of Missouri twice: once in 1833 and finally in 1838 – not to mention the failed military march of Zion’s Camp in 1834 to redeem Zion. Despite the Lord’s promises to fight their battles and provide divine assistance, Joseph and the Mormons failed to build Zion.

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Third Concept – The early Mormons would return at a future date – in their lifetimes – to Jackson County to build the holy city of Zion. After fleeing Missouri in 1838, the Mormons settled in Nauvoo. Joseph would live another six years before being murdered after ordering the destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor – a newspaper exposing the secrets of polygamy and other kingdom-building activities. During those six years, Joseph made no attempt to return to Jackson County to establish Zion. However, the idea that the Mormons would one day return and fulfill the divine commands of Lord in Missouri persisted. After all, it was Christ’s will and was essential for the Second Coming. And the Mormons had been promised by their prophet that they had significant roles to play in preparing the earth where they would rule with Christ from Jackson County during the Millennium.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Brigham stated in 1845, “And when we get into Jackson County … we can say we built this temple: for as the Lord lives, we will build up Jackson County in this generation.”  First Presidency Counselor Heber Kimball believed he would return to Jackson County in his lifetime. He stated in 1861, “Brethren, I shall go to Jackson County with thousands of this people who will be faithful.”  Heber prophesied to Amanda Wilcox in 1868, “… the Prophet Joseph and others will make their appearance and those who have remained faithful will be selected to return to Jackson County, Missouri and take part in the upbuilding of that beautiful city, the New Jerusalem.”

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The first Mormon pioneers arrived in Utah in 1847 with Zion and Jackson County still on their minds. In 1857 Heber Kimball said of Jackson County, “I shall yet see the day that I will go back there, with brother Brigham and with thousands and millions of others, and we will go precisely according to the dedication of the Prophet of the living God … I am just as confident of it as I am that I am called to be a savior of men, and no power can hinder it.”  Millions of Mormons traveling to Jackson County? Heber had been promised by Joseph that he had been “called to be a savior of men” Heber died in 1868 and none of this came to pass. In 1857 Elias Smith said, “I expect to live to be an old man, and to go back with the saints to the land of Jackson County.” To which Brigham Young responded from the stand, “God grant it.”  Elias died in 1888.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In 1861, Mormon apostle George Smith declared that his generation would not pass away before the temple was built. “Who is there that is prepared for this movement back to the center stake of Zion, and where are the architects amongst us that are qualified to erect this temple and the city that will surround it … let me remind you that it is predicted that this generation shall not pass away till a temple shall be built, and the glory of the Lord rest upon it, according to the promises.”  George died in 1875.

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In 1864 Mormon apostle George Cannon stated that the current generation would build a temple in Jackson County. “The day is near when a Temple shall be reared in the Center Stake of Zion, and the Lord has said his glory shall rest on that House in this generation, that is in the generation in which the revelation was given, which is upwards of thirty years ago.”  George died in 1901. In 1870, Apostle Orson Pratt taught, “We have just as much confidence in returning to Jackson County and the building of a great city that will remain there a thousand years ... There are many of the old stock … still living, whose faith in returning to Jackson County, and the things that are coming, is as firm and fixed as the throne of the Almighty.”  Orson died in 1881.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The idea of returning to Jackson County to build the holy city of Zion stretched into the 20th century. Mormon apostle Orson Whitney stated in 1916, “Is the State of Utah the proper monument of the ‘Mormon’ people? No ... The monument to ‘Mormonism’ will stand in Jackson County, Mo. There the great City will be built: There Zion will arise and shine, ‘the joy of the whole Earth,’ and there the Lord will come to His temple in His own time, when His people shall have made the required preparation.”  But the Mormons never returned to Jackson County despite all of Joseph’s prophecies. And church leaders today never mention returning to build Zion.

        <h3>Zion Built by the Lamanites</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In 1833, Joseph Smith wrote, “The Book of Mormon is a record of the forefathers of our western tribes of Indians … By it we learn that our western tribes of Indians are descendants from that Joseph that was sold into Egypt, and that the land of America is a promised land unto them.”  The Book of Mormon title page announces that it is “… written to the Lamanites, which are a remnant of the House of Israel.”  The book’s purpose is to teach Native Americans that they are descendants of the House of Israel. That they have a divinely appointed role to accept the gospel in the last days and return to the covenant with the House of Israel.

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Nephi prophesied of the future Lamanites, “And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them (Lamanites); wherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their fathers (Book of Mormon Lamanites), and also to the knowledge of Jesus Christ … and their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a white and a delightsome people.”  However, this prophecy was never fulfilled!

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In the Book of Mormon, the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh (sons of Joseph sold into Egypt) are brought into one family bloodline. Lehi is from the tribe of Manasseh.  Joseph Smith stated that Lehi’s wife, Sariah, was from the tribe of Ephraim.  Lehi had four sons and two daughters. Desiring wives and husbands for his children, Lehi sent for Ishmael, a descendant of the tribe of Ephraim. According to Mormon apostle Erastus Snow “Joseph (Smith) informed us that . . . Ishmael was of the lineage of Ephraim, and that his sons [had] married into Lehi’s family, and Lehi’s sons married Ishmael’s daughters.”
