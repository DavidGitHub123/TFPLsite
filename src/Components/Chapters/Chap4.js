          The term “Zion” appears in the Old Testament in 2 Samuel 5:7. This
          verse refers to a hill, Mount Zion, located near Jerusalem. Mount Zion
          was a Jebusite fortress conquered by King David and renamed the City
          of David. Throughout Jewish history, the term Zion has come to
          simultaneously refer to the Temple Mount, the city of Jerusalem, and
          all the land of Israel. Zion also holds symbolic meaning for the Jews.
          Zion is the spiritual center of Israel. It also represents “The World
          to Come” with Zion as the location of the heavenly paradise of the
          afterlife.

          Zion is mentioned 152 times in the Bible, most often in Psalms,
          Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Lamentations. In Psalm 137, Zion is remembered
          from the perspective of the Babylonian captivity, after the
          Babylonians sacked Jerusalem in 586 BCE. “By the rivers of Babylon,
          there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. We hanged
          our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there they that
          carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us
          required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.”

      <h2 className="headlinePadding" >Origin of Joseph’s Idea of Zion, the New Jerusalem</h2>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          Where did Joseph get the idea of building a holy city of Zion, a New
          Jerusalem, in the Americas? The Book of Revelation states, “And I John
          saw the Holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven,
          prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice
          out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and
          he will dwell with them.” 
          <a id="clickable12" className="footnote">12  </a>
          <Tooltip anchorSelect="#clickable12" className="footnote-size"  clickable>Revelation 21:2-3.</Tooltip>
          
          This sounds much like the Book of Mormon’s
          description of Christ in the Americas. “And behold, this people
          (future Lamanites) will I establish in this land (America), unto the
          fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your father Jacob; and it
          shall be a New Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven shall be in the
          midst of this people; yea, even I will be in the midst of you.”

          More than two centuries prior to Joseph Smith’s day, America was a
          destination for new religious freedom. The Pilgrims arrived at
          Plymouth Rock in 1620, followed by the Puritans in 1630. Other
          religious groups followed. The Puritans believed they were a chosen
          people of God, living in the promised land of America that they
          sometimes called the new Israel. It has been stated, “The Puritans saw
          themselves as a chosen people, commissioned by God to build a New
          Jerusalem, or a City of Zion, in America – an exemplary community that
          all could observe and emulate.”

      <div className="paragraph">

          The idea of a New Jerusalem in America was referenced in the 17th
          century by Samuel Sewall when he asked, “… why the Heart of America
          may not be the seat of the New Jerusalem?” Puritan clergyman Cotton
          Mather stated that the New Jerusalem would be westward, beyond the
          confines of New England.

          While some looked for a New Jerusalem in the
          state of New York, others spiritualized the idea and spoke of Zion in
          the revivals of the 1820s. Such expressions as “growing zeal for the
          prosperity of Zion,” and “enquiring the way to Zion” and “wishes well
          to the cause of Zion” were expressions of the revival movement and
          referred to the building up of churches.

      <h2 className="headlinePadding" >God’s Directive to the Mormons</h2>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          Joseph convinced the early Mormons that it was God’s directive to
          them, as descendants of the Tribes of Israel and exclusive holders of
          God’s restored priesthood authority, to establish Zion as a center for
          God’s power in Jackson County, Missouri. Notice the Old Testament
          references in these letters Joseph wrote about establishing Zion.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          Joseph wrote in 1833, “The city of Zion spoken of by David, in the one
          hundred and second Psalm, will be built upon the land of America, ‘And
          the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and
          everlasting joy upon their heads’ (Isaiah 35:10); and then they will
          be delivered from the overflowing scourge that shall pass through the
          land. But Judah shall obtain deliverance at Jerusalem. (Joel 2:32;
          Isaiah 26:20–21; Jeremiah 31:12; Psalm 1:5; Ezekiel 34:11–13.) These
          are testimonies that the Good Shepherd will put forth [to] His own
          sheep and lead them out from all nations where they have been
          scattered in a cloudy and dark day, to Zion, and to Jerusalem.”

      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          In another letter Joseph wrote in 1835, “I shall begin by quoting from
          the prophecy of Enoch, speaking of the last days: ‘Righteousness and
          truth will I cause to sweep the earth as with a flood, to gather out
          mine own elect from the four quarters of the earth, unto a place which
          I shall prepare, a holy city, that my people may gird up their loins,
          and be looking forth for the time of my coming, for there shall be my
          tabernacle, and it shall be called Zion, a New Jerusalem (Moses 7:62).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          “Now I understand by this quotation, that … righteousness and truth
          are to sweep the earth as with a flood. And now, I ask, how
          righteousness and truth are going to sweep the earth as with a flood?
          I will answer. Men and angels are to be co-workers in bringing to pass
          this great work, and Zion is to be prepared, even a new Jerusalem, for
          the elect that are to be gathered from the four quarters of the earth,
          and to be established an holy city, for the tabernacle of the Lord
          shall be with them …

          “… ’Behold this people will I establish in this land, unto the
          fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your father Jacob, and it
          shall be a New Jerusalem.’ (3 Nephi 20:22.) Now we learn from the Book
          of Mormon the very identical continent and spot of land upon which the
          New Jerusalem is to stand, and it must be caught up according to the
          vision of John upon the isle of Patmos.

          “Now many will feel disposed to say, that this New Jerusalem spoken
          of, is the Jerusalem that was built by the Jews on the eastern
          continent. But you will see, from Revelation 21:2, there was a New
          Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, adorned as a bride for
          her husband; that after this, the Revelator was caught away in the
          Spirit, to a great and high mountain, and saw the great and holy city
          descending out of heaven from God. Now there are two cities spoken of
          here. As everything cannot be had in so narrow a compass as a letter,
          I shall say with brevity, that there is a New Jerusalem to be
          established on this continent, and also Jerusalem shall be rebuilt on
          the eastern continent (see Ether 13:1–12). ‘Behold, Ether saw the days
          of Christ, and he spake also concerning the house of Israel, and the
          Jerusalem from whence Lehi should come; after it should be destroyed,
          it should be built up again, a holy city unto the Lord, wherefore it
          could not be a New Jerusalem, for it had been in a time of old.’

          pine tree, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of His
          sanctuary, that He may make the place of His feet glorious (see Isaiah
          60:13). Where for brass, He will bring gold; and for iron, He will
          bring silver; and for wood, brass; and for stones, iron (see Isaiah
          60:17); and where the feast of fat things will be given to the just
          (see Isaiah 25:6); yea, when the splendor of the Lord is brought to
          our consideration for the good of His people, the calculations of men
          and the vain glory of the world vanish, and we exclaim, ‘Out of Zion
          the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.’ (Psalm 50:2.)”

      <div className="paragraph">

          Joseph Smith began revising the Bible after the church was founded. In
          December 1830 he dictated an account of another holy city, a New
          Jerusalem, known as the City of Enoch. The idea of building a holy
          city of Zion was a near obsession for Joseph. Five verses in the Old
          Testament mentions Enoch. “And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two
          years, and he begat Enoch … And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and
          begat Methuselah: And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah
          three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of
          Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years: And Enoch walked with
          God: and he was not; for God took him.”

           “Enoch journeyed in the land …
          and as he journeyed, the Spirit of God descended out of heaven, and
          abode upon him.” Enoch hears a voice from heaven telling the people to
          repent. God is angry because the peoples’ hearts have waxed hard. “…
          ever since the day that I created them, have they gone astray, and
          have denied me, and have sought their own counsels in the dark.” Enoch
          begins preaching repentance and “no man laid hands on him; for fear
          came on all them that heard him; for he walked with God.” “And as
          Enoch spake forth the words of God, the people trembled and could not
          stand in his presence.”

          Enoch asks the people to be baptized in the name of Christ. “… all
          men, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the
          kingdom of God, for no unclean thing can dwell there.” Enoch beheld
          visions. “And from that time forth Enoch began to prophesy … as I
          stood upon the mount, I beheld the heavens open, and I

          Enoch had great faith. “And so great was the faith of Enoch that he
          led the people of God, and their enemies came to battle against them;
          and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the
          mountains fled, even according to his command … and all nations feared
          greatly, so powerful was the word of Enoch, and so great was the power
          of the language which God had given him.” Eventually, Enoch and his
          people became so righteous that, “… the Lord came and dwelt with his
          people, and they dwelt in righteousness … And the Lord called his
          people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in
          righteousness; and there was no poor among them.” Enoch builds a city
          “called the City of Holiness, even Zion … [and] in process of time,
          [Zion] was taken up into heaven.”
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          Next in the narrative, Enoch is shown historical events, including the
          death and resurrection of Christ. “And he heard a loud voice; and the
          heavens were veiled; and all the creations of God mourned; and the
          earth groaned; and the rocks were rent; and the saints arose and were
          crowned at the right hand of the Son of Man, with crowns of glory.”
          After watching Christ ascend to the Father, Enoch asks, “… wilt not
          come again on the earth.” Enoch is answered, “… I will come in the
          last days, in the days of wickedness and vengeance … and the heavens
          shall shake, and also the earth; and great tribulations shall be among
          the children of men.”
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          The Lord continues, “And righteousness will I send down out of heaven;
          and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of
          mine Only Begotten … to sweep the earth as with a flood, to gather out
          mine elect from the four quarters of the earth, unto a place which I
          shall prepare, an Holy City (Jackson County), that my people may gird
          up their loins, and be looking forth for the time of my coming; for
          there shall be my tabernacle, and it shall be called Zion, a New
          Jerusalem.”
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          Next the Lord tells Enoch that his holy city, which had fled the
          earth, in the last days will return. “… thy city [will] meet them
          there, and we will receive them into our bosom, and they shall see us;
          and we will fall upon their necks, and they shall fall upon our necks,
          and we will kiss each other; And there shall be mine abode, and it
          shall be Zion … and for the space of a thousand years the earth shall
          rest.” As in the Old Testament timeline, the events of Enoch’s life
          predate those of Noah. 
          <a id="clickable26" className="footnote">26  </a>
          <Tooltip anchorSelect="#clickable26" className="footnote-size"  clickable>According to George Laub journal, Joseph stated “The place or country where Noah’s ark was built was designated in my hearing by the Prophet Joseph Smith as being in or near South Carolina.” The Young Woman’s Journal, II, (December 1890), pp. 124-125; Hyrum L. Andrus and Helen Mae Andrus, They Knew the Prophet, 65.</Tooltip>
          
          These events, as described by Joseph Smith,
          occurred in the center of the United States. Therefore, the site of
          the latter-day Zion, the New Jerusalem, is believed to be the site of
          Enoch’s holy city of Zion.

      <h2 className="headlinePadding" >Becoming Kings and Priests, Queens and Priestesses in Zion</h2>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          According to Joseph, Zion must be established upon the Temple. This
          includes an order of kings and priests, queens and priestesses, who
          have built their lives on God’s laws of obedience, sacrifice, the
          Gospel, chastity, and consecration. Those who dwell in Zion are the
          truly righteous who have been sanctified from sin and the moral
          uncleanliness of this world. Through temple covenants and righteous
          living, they have been spiritually transformed. They will live worthy
          to receive their second anointings and to be sealed to the highest
          degree of exaltation in the celestial kingdom. They will receive the
          fullness of the priesthood, and have their callings and elections made
          sure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          To Joseph, specific priesthood laws governed different celestial,
          terrestrial, and telestial glories. Priesthood was hierarchically
          arranged into “higher” and “lesser” orders. These hierarchies were
          governed by light and priesthood keys. The greater a person’s
          righteousness, the greater the priesthood hierarchy they achieve.
          Priesthood power was analogous to the positive forces of light. Think
          of the light of the sun and how it creates and sustain life. Joseph
          believed that through righteousness, and the priesthood, a man could
          sanctify himself to the point he could become commensurate with the
          Most High Gods in eternity.

      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          For Joseph, priesthood was an ancient sacred power that originated
          with the first God of all Gods. This is the power that Michael/Adam
          possessed and brought to this earth and into the Garden of Eden.
          According to Mormon scripture, priesthood power flowed from Adam
          through his lineage, eventually down to Abraham and then to Moses.

          Joseph desired to confer this priesthood power on the early Mormons.

      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          For Joseph, priesthood is a power harnessed by the endless
          hierarchical chain of Gods to spread their dominion, creating and
          populating worlds. Through the priesthood, the Gods move from higher
          and higher spheres of righteousness and eternal mastery. The early
          Mormons were taught that through sealing ordinances, they could do the
          same.

      <div className="paragraph">

          Joseph’s aim for his followers was to sanctify their lives and become
          filled with the tangible light of God’s glory. In a real, physical
          sense, a Mormon was to fill themselves with principles of heavenly
          light and truth. “That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth
          light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light
          groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.”

          Joseph
          explained, “And the redemption of the soul is through him that
          quickeneth all things … Therefore, it (the soul) must needs be
          sanctified from all unrighteousness, that it may be prepared for the
          celestial glory; For after it hath filled the measure of its creation,
          it shall be crowned with glory … That bodies who are of the celestial
          kingdom may possess it forever and ever; for, for this intent was it
          made and created, and for this intent are they sanctified.”

          At a meeting of the Relief Society, Joseph promised that women could
          eventually “come in possession of the privileges, blessings, and gifts
          of the Priesthood” and would be given “the keys of the kingdom” if
          they were virtuous and diligent.

          <Tooltip anchorSelect="#clickable32" className="footnote-size"  clickable>Romans 8:17.</Tooltip>
          
          meant “to inherit the same glory power & exaltation” and
          to “ascend [to] a throne as those who have gone before.” Speaking for
          Christ, Joseph stated, “… when I get my kingdom worked out, I will
          present to the father & it will exalt his glory” so that “he will take
          a higher exaltation & I will take his place and am also exalted.”
          Thus, the Father “obtains kingdom rolling upon kingdom so that Jesus
          treads in his tracks as he had gone before.”

          George Laub was present for the King Follet discourse. He understood

          the next may be raised to his place or sphere and so take their
          exaltation through a regular channel. And when we get to where Jesus
          is he will be as far ahead of us in exaltation as when we started.”

          In short, the residents of Zion will work to achieve godhood. As they
          increased in righteousness, they receive endowments of glory and power
          of gods as they climb the ladder of exaltation. Joseph taught, “When
          you climb a ladder, you must begin at the bottom and go on until you
          learn the last principle; it will be a great while before you have
          learned the last … It is a great thing to learn salvation beyond the
          grave.”

          Joseph was telling his followers that they could ascend
          Jacob’s Ladder and became gods. “Then shall they be gods, because they
          have no end; therefore, shall they be from everlasting to everlasting,
          because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all
          things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they
          have all power, and the angels are subject unto them.”

          Joseph told his followers, “You have got to learn how to be Gods
          yourselves; to be kings and priests to God, the same as all Gods have
          done; by going from a small degree to another, from grace to grace,
          from exaltation to exaltation, until you are able to sit in glory as
          doeth those who sit enthroned in everlasting power.” Therefore,
          through a process of sanctification and by the power of the
          priesthood, the early Mormons believed that they could be transformed
          into gods. They would one day take up the matter of the universe, and
          by applying the laws of the Gods, expand the cosmos to create and
          people worlds.

          For Joseph, this all begins in Zion and establishing the Kingdom of

          Sacrament meeting.
