        <h1 className='chapterHeading'>Chapter 3: Joseph’s Visionary Prowess</h1>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph’s vision of building the Kingdom of God was expansive and impressive. From his small band of followers in the 1830s, Joseph believed that the kingdom he was establishing would grow in power and might. The Mormons would bring to pass the “literal gathering of Israel and … the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built on the American continent.”  Then the stage would be set for the latter-day events prophesied in the Bible, and Christ would appear and usher in the Millennium.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Building the Kingdom of God requires builders. It would be necessary to gather the elect of God, the righteous leaven of the earth, to a central location. Joseph revealed, “Hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith the Lord your God, who have assembled yourselves together … in this land … which I have appointed and consecrated for the gathering of the saints. Wherefore, this is the land of promise, and the place for the city of Zion.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph took inspiration from Isaiah, “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.”  From Joseph’s Book of Mormon, Nephi prophesied, “And the time cometh speedily that the righteous must be led up as calves of the stall, and the Holy One of Israel must reign in dominion, and might, and power, and great glory. And he gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth.”  According to Joseph, that location was Jackson County, Missouri. Joseph revealed, “I will give it unto you for the land of your inheritance, if you seek it with all your hearts. And this shall be my covenant with you.”  
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph’s revelations led early Mormons to believe that they were inheriting sacred land that they would possess forever, into the Millennium. The lands around Jackson County were the location of the Garden of Eden. According to Joseph, after Adam and Eve left the garden, human civilizations began to spread from this location. Just before the Second Coming, a great council would be held nearby at Adam-ondi-Ahman where Adam would bless his posterity.

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>You can imagine the early Mormons’ surprise several years later when they were driven from their “everlasting inheritances”  which had been given to them by their prophet through a revelation from Christ.

        <h3>Zion Reared in the First Generation of Early Mormons</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>According to the church today, its mission is to help “all of God’s children come to Jesus Christ through learning about His gospel, making and keeping promises with God (covenants), and practicing Christlike love and service.” But that is not the original mission of the church. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>According to Mormon scripture and Joseph’s prophetic utterances, the purpose of the restoration was the gathering of the righteous elect from the four corners of the earth. To make them kings and priests, and queens and priestesses. To establish a physical, temporal Kingdom of God in the holy city, which would serve as a refuge for the righteous in the last days prior to Christ’s Second Coming – where the world and its wickedness would be consumed in the fire and light and Christ’s presence. Much more exciting!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph revealed in 1832 that the establishment of Zion was to take place within the lifetime of the early church members, to be “reared in this generation.”  The 1832 revelation states, “Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his church, established in the last days … for the gathering of his saints to stand upon Mount Zion, which shall be the city of New Jerusalem … even the place of the temple, which temple, shall be reared in this generation. For verily, this generation shall not all pass away until a house shall be built unto the Lord, and a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even the glory of The Lord.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>When “the Lord” says “a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even the glory of the Lord” imagine an intense shaft of heavenly light full of intelligence, knowledge, and spirit illuminating the holy city. Joseph taught of the future city, “Ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn.”  The Church of the Firstborn refers to exalted beings who gain entrance into the highest degree of the Celestial Kingdom.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>If true, it sounds wonderful to be in this theophany – none of the earthly woes and sorrows we experience. All nations of the earth will look to the holy city of Zion. Joseph revealed in 1832, “And the nations of the earth shall honor her and shall say: Surely Zion is the city of our God, and surely Zion cannot fall, neither be moved out of her place, for God is there, and the hand of the Lord is there.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mormons Redefine Generation</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In 1832, there were 2,661 Mormons.  According to this revelation, these 2,661 Mormons would see Zion established. If a generation is 20-30 years,  that would place the building of Zion between 1852 and 1862. Therefore, at the latest, the 1860s was the decade to watch. However, Zion was not established in Jackson County in the lifetimes of the early Mormons – during the 1860s. But as the decades passed, the Mormons continued to believe. Mormon apostle Orson Pratt stated in 1870, “God promised in the year 1832 that we should, before this generation then living had passed away, return and build up the City of Zion in Jackson County … He promised us that He would manifest Himself on that temple, that the glory of God should be upon it.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Orson continued, “The Latter-day Saints just as much expect to receive a fulfillment of that promise during the generation that was in existence in 1832 as they expect that the sun will rise and set tomorrow. Why? Because God cannot lie.”  Orson stated in 1871 about the 1832 revelation, “We just as much expect that a city will be built, called Zion … in the generation when this revelation was given; we just as much expect this as we expect the sun to rise in the morning and set in the evening … But say the objector, “thirty-nine years have passed away.” What of that? The generation has not passed away; all the people that were living thirty-nine years ago have not passed away; but before they do pass away this will be fulfilled.”  Yet, it never happened.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The early Mormons were promised that they would see Zion built and Christ return in their lifetimes. Lyman Johnson was promised that “He shall see the Savior come and stand upon the earth with power and great glory.”  Heber Kimball was promised that “He may stand unto the coming of our Lord.”  Orson Hyde was promised “That he may stand upon the earth and bring souls till Christ comes.”  William Smith was blessed that “He shall be preserved and remain on the earth until Christ shall come to take vengeance on the wicked.”  
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In 1935, 105 years (more than three generations) Mormon apostle Joseph Fielding Smith stated, “I firmly believe that there will be some of that generation who were living when this revelation was given (1832) who shall be living when this temple is reared. And I do not believe that the Lord has bound himself to accomplish the matter within 100 years from 1832 … I have full confidence in the word of the Lord and that it shall not fail.”  
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Still at it, then-prophet Joseph Fielding Smith stated in 1972 – 140 years after the 1832 revelation (more than five generations), “It may be reasonable to assume that in giving this revelation to the prophet the Lord did have in mind the generation of people who would still be living within the one hundred years from the time of announcement of the revelation, and that they would enjoy the blessings of the temple, and a glorious cloud would rest upon it. It is also reasonable to believe that no soul living in 1832 is still living in mortality on the earth.”  Where did he come up with the 100-year requirement?  
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The truth of the matter is that six years after the 1832 revelation, the Mormons were driven from Missouri in 1838. Large numbers of Mormons had poured into the state, announcing that the land settled and owned by the Missourians had been given to the Mormons by God for their everlasting inheritances. This naturally infuriated the Missourians. The threat of being displaced from their homes and farms created tensions. Missourians began violently pushing back against the Mormons. Omitted from church history lessons today, the Mormons pushed back violently as well – even criminally.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Claiming the need to retaliate against the malevolent Missourians, the Mormons formed the Danites. This oath-bound group went about stealing and storing their plunder in bishop storehouses. Just as the Missourians were doing, the Mormon Danites destroyed Missourians’ property, killing livestock, and burning barns.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Hostilities increased to the point that the conflict was named the Mormon War. Finally, the governor issued the extermination order on October 27, 1838, stating, “… the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace – their outrages are beyond all description.”  The governor was echoing First Presidency Counselor Sidney Rigdon’s previous words, “And that mob that comes on us to disturb us, it shall be between us and them a war of extermination; for we will follow them until the last drop of their blood is spilled.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Between 1832 and 1838, both Mormons and Missourians were killed and beaten – all in an attempt to obey their prophet and establish Zion, God’s holy city. Eventually, Joseph and church leaders were imprisoned in Liberty Jail for war crimes. The Mormons had lost practically everything. In the dead of winter, Joseph’s followers fled for Nauvoo – their immediate hopes of building the holy city of Zion dashed. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>However, there was a silver lining for Joseph. The events of Missouri, and the maltreatment the Mormons endured, galvanized Joseph’s followers. The persecution they suffered carved a deep conviction that Mormonism was the true gospel into their souls. For decades and decades, Mormons would replay a one-sided persecution narrative over pulpits and talk of the Lord leading the Mormons back to their promised land one day.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Brigham stated in 1845, “… as the Lord lives we will build up Jackson county in this generation.”  First Presidency Counselor Heber Kimball stated in 1861 that in his lifetime, “Brethren, I shall go to Jackson County with thousands of this people who will be faithful.”  But what reason did Joseph give his followers for his failed revelations regarding the building of Zion? Christ had promised “… assemble yourselves together to rejoice upon the land of Missouri, which is the land of your inheritance, which is now the land of your enemies. But, behold, I, the Lord, will hasten the city in its time, and will crown the faithful with joy and with rejoicing.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Just as a treasure diviner blames the men digging for not following instructions, Joseph blamed the Mormons for their unrighteousness. “Behold … were it not for the transgressions of my people, speaking concerning the church and not individuals, they might have been redeemed even now. But behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things which I required at their hands, but are full of all manner of evil … And are not united according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Later, we will review the dark history of the failed attempt to build Zion in greater detail.
