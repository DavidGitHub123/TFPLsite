            Joseph believed he had succeeded, stating near the end of his life, “Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah! … I have done 
            what king Solomon, King Hiram, & Hiram Abiff could not do: I have set up the kingdom no more to be thrown down forever

          <p>Joseph was not a quitter. Six years after being forced out of Missouri in 1838, without establishing the holy city of Zion, 
            in March 1844 Joseph organized the Council of Fifty – the governmental structure of the Kingdom of God.

           But when it comes to Council of Fifty minutes, for which historians have been requesting access for decades, the church kept these documents hidden for more than 150 years. The church finally granted access to these materials in 2016 as part of the Joseph Smith Papers Project.  The Council of Fifty minutes lift the lid on Joseph’s secret designs for building a theocracy and shed light on the circumstances of his murder.

        <h2 className="headlinePadding">Constitutional Structure of the Kingdom of God</h2>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph and the Council of Fifty believed they had a divine mandate to establish a constitutional structure of a temporal 
            Kingdom of God. The Council’s stated purpose was “to organize the political kingdom of God in preparation for the Second 
            Coming of Christ.”

            The kingdom they were establishing would serve as the foundation for Christ’s Millennial government. This Kingdom would serve as an umbrella of divine authority, ruling all nations, implementing the laws of God. Each nation would be free to govern itself if it governed within the bounds of the Mormon theocracy.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph received the name of the council by revelation, “Verily thus saith the Lord, this is the name by which you shall 
            be called, The Kingdom of God and His Laws, With the Keys and Power Thereof, and Judgement in the Hands of His Servants.”

            The name was shortened to Council of Fifty because 50 men eventually were admitted to the Council, witnessing Joseph’s ordination as “King, Priest, and Ruler over Israel on the Earth” – and the placing of a crown upon his head.

            ceremonies.  At times, the Council of Fifty referred to themselves as “princes in the Kingdom of God,” and “fifty princes of 
            the Kingdom.”

          <p>Joseph revealed that it was God’s will that this secret group was to receive, “… from this time henceforth and forever,

          <p>Because the Mormons believed Joseph was the only prophet on earth and the sole mouthpiece of God, they felt justified in

            or shall reveal unto my servants the prophets and I have appointed one man, holding the keys and authority, pertaining to my 
            holy priesthood, to whom I will reveal my laws, my statutes, my ordinances, my Judgements, my will and pleasure concerning my

        <h2 className="headlinePadding">Council of Fifty Not Symbolic</h2>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>At the time Joseph organized the Council of Fifty he had an army of the Nauvoo Legion at his command, which was larger than the state militia. He had a secret police force of oath-bound Danites to protect him. The Nauvoo courts were in his pocket as he had written the city charter to guarantee he was untouchable from extradition by lawsuit and criminal prosecution for past crimes. He was the mayor. He had numerous wives and alliances through those marriages with the elite of Mormonism. He had made covenants with his closest followers, promising them that through obedience to him as prophet they would one day be kings and priests, and queens and priestesses. No wonder at this time, the Illinois state legislature was debating repealing the Nauvoo charter.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Today, the Mormon church claims that the activities of the Council of Fifty were merely symbolic. The church claims that the governmental structure was simply fanciful thinking and that it would be organized officially at the return of Christ. Other times, the church claims the Council of Fifty’s purpose was to support Joseph’s bid as a candidate for the U.S. presidency. Both ideas are distortions of the true purpose and intent of the Council of Fifty, of which the modern church leaders and historians are aware.

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>We will see later the Mormons, under Joseph’s leadership, were laying out real plans with real objectives to establish a 
            literal kingdom that would rule all nations of the world until Christ appeared. According to historian Klaus Hansen, members 
            of the Council of Fifty believed it was their divinely appointed mission to follow Joseph’s violent, apocalyptic vision of 
            ruling the world as a theocracy to destroy the wicked kingdoms of the world in establishing the Mormon Kingdom of God on 
            the earth.

            the American continent had been given to the Lamanites (Native Americans) as a land of their inheritance as they were of the 
            House of Israel – the rightful heirs to the Kingdom of God. In 3 Nephi, the resurrected Christ preached, “And behold, this 
            people (future Lamanites) will I establish in this land (America), unto the fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your 
            father Jacob; and it shall be a New Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven shall be in the midst of this people; yea, even I

            beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in

          <p>To Joseph and the Council of Fifty, their justification for the forthcoming bloodshed at the hands of the Native Americans was that the Gentile nation of the United States had rejected the Mormon gospel. As prophesied in the Book of Mormon, now was the time for the Mormons and the Native Americans to descend upon the Gentiles and destroy them to cleanse the land in preparation for the return of Christ. The Book of Mormon prophesies that the Native Americans under the direction of God will destroy the Gentiles (anyone not of the House of Israel) unless they “repent,” meaning embrace the Mormon gospel.

            In their 11 March 1844 minutes, the Council of Fifty discussed establishing a settlement outside the United States.

          <p>By March 1844, opposition toward Joseph and the church in and around Nauvoo was its highest point. This was largely due, in part, to rumors of polygamy and the Mormons’ growing political power as devoted converted poured into the area. Outside the United States, the Mormons could create their own theocratic government – free to practice their religion as they pleased.
