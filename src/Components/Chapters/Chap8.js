          However, this opposition will work to Zion’s advantage. The opposition
          will purify the Zion builders through a refining fire, instilling
          great spiritual power. Nephi beheld that, as the world fights against
          Zion, the inhabitants will be endowed “with the power of God in great
          glory.”

          With this power and glory, “the sons and daughters of the

          as Moroni quoted the words of the Old Testament prophet Joel to Joseph
          Smith.

          As the Mormons and Lamanites build Zion, the people will increase in
          righteousness and become truly Christlike. They will be filled with
          tangible glory so that they personally, and the city they are
          building, will shine forth as a beacon to the world. Mormon apostle
          Orson Pratt stated, “… her dwellings shall be encircled with glory;
          her light shall be as the sun, and her beauty as the morning; her
          tabernacles shall be as the dwelling places, kings shall arise and
          worship.”

          The Book of Mormon gives an example of this. During Christ’s
          appearance to the Nephites, he promised that the people would be
          baptized “with fire and with the Holy Ghost.” “And as they looked to
          behold, they cast their eyes toward heaven, and they saw the heavens
          open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the
          midst of fire, and they came down and encircled those little ones
          about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did
          minister unto them.”

          countenance did shine upon them, and behold they were as white as the
          countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and behold the whiteness

          To an even greater degree, Zion will be endowed with glory. A fire and
          flame of glory will consume the dross and purify all physical
          elements. The people, buildings, and streets will shine and burn with
          holy flame. Third Mormon prophet John Taylor declared, “In the name of
          Israel’s God,” Zion will be built and that “the glory of God” will
          “rest upon it, upon every dwelling in Mount Zion.”

          The glory around and about will fill the people’s minds, opening the
          visions of eternity – past, present, and future. It will be like a
          fountain of living water. The people will move about in paradisiacal
          glory, a tangible element of warmth and love.

          Of this glory in Zion, Mormon apostle Orson Pratt stated, “That true
          light that emanates from the great fountain of light, the Messiah, ...
          will be rendered visible to the eyes of all the inhabitants of that
          city. And shall I limit it there? No. The Light will shine so
          conspicuously from that city, extending to the very heavens, that it
          will in reality be like unto a city set upon a hill that cannot be
          hid, and it will have quite a tendency to strike terror to all the
          nations of the earth.”

          Zion is the power and glory that Enoch and his people achieved. “And
          Enoch and all his people walked with God, and he dwelt in the midst of
          Zion; and it came to pass that Zion was not, for God received it up
          into his own bosom; and from thence went forth the saying, Zion is
          Fled.”

          Enoch’s Zion was too pure and holy to remain on the earth. But,
          according to Joseph, the city will return. Zion is the power and glory
          God attempted to give Israel through Moses at Mount Sinai, but the
          Israelites rejected it. Isaiah stated, “Awake, awake; put on thy
          strength, O Zion,” which means Joseph Smith explained, “to return to
          that power which she had lost.”

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          The inhabitants of Zion will also be made terrible, for the glory of
          the Lord will be upon Zion. Joseph revealed, “The day shall come when
          the nations of the earth shall tremble because of her and shall fear
          because of her terrible ones.”

          As Zion increases in righteousness, the
          holy city will become more and more spiritualized to the point it is
          worthy to receive visitations from Christ – prior to his appearance to
          the world at his Second Coming. At that point, Christ’s glory will
          rest upon Zion, raising it to an even greater sanctified level. Upon
          every dwelling place of Mount Zion, the Lord will create a cloud and
          smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all,
          the glory of Zion shall be a defence.

          Joseph revealed, “She shall prosper, and spread herself and become

          earth shall honor her and shall say: Surely Zion is the city of our
          God, and surely Zion cannot fall, neither be moved out of her place,

          But in proportion as Zion prospers, increasingly gross wickedness will
          cover the earth. God’s spirit will withdraw from humankind. Spiritual
          darkness will cloud people’s minds. Murder, exploitation, whoredoms,
          and fornications will run rampant. People will be as in Noah’s day
          before the flood – to which God responded, “And God saw that the
          wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination
          of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it
          repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth.”

          The Book of Mormon gives a glimpse of the wickedness that Joseph
          prophesied would cover the earth before the Second Coming. Prior to
          the end of Nephite civilization, the people were “without principle
          and past feeling.” Mormon wrote, “A continual scene of wickedness and
          abominations has been before mine eyes.”

          “Many of the daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoner, and

          in a most cruel manner … devour[ing] their flesh like unto wild

          Carthage ... he told several of us of the night the visions of heaven
          were open to him, in which he saw the American continent drenched in
          blood, and he saw nation rising up against nation. He saw the father
          shed the blood of the son, and the son the blood of the father; the
          mother put to death the daughter, and the daughter the mother; and
          natural affection forsook the hearts of the wicked.”

          daughters, and daughters seeking the lives of their mothers. I saw
          armies arrayed against armies. I saw blood, desolation, fires. The Son

          and perhaps millions. Their widows and orphans will be compelled to
