          <p>But let’s start at the beginning, your very beginning – in shadowy pasts of the premortal world. Mormonism teaches that among Heavenly 
            Father’s spirit children in the premortal worlds, there was a group of valiant, elite, “noble and great” spirits.

            If you are a Mormon, 
            in the premortal world you were among the elite children of God. You were reserved to come to this earth in the last days. You were 
            destined to undertake the heavy lifting of building Zion – the Kingdom of God – and preparing the world for the Second Coming. 
            In this premortal world, you were set apart to receive specific callings in your mortal life. You were to be raised in the privileged circumstances of a Mormon home in the Abrahamic covenant. Here you were to flourish living under the restored gospel.

          <p>Thirteenth Mormon prophet Ezra Benson taught, “You have been born at this time for a sacred and glorious purpose … Your birth was 
            foreordained in the eternities. You are to be ‘the royal army of the Lord in the last days.’ You are youth of the noble birthright.”

            Sixth Mormon prophet Joseph F. Smith, revealed, “Even before they were born, they, with many others, received their first lessons in the world of spirits and 
            were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men.”

          <p>A church pamphlet, True to the Faith, states, “In the premortal spirit world, God appointed certain spirits to fulfill specific missions during their mortal lives. 
            This is called foreordination … Such opportunities come in this life as a result of the righteous exercise of agency … in the premortal existence.”

            Joseph revealed a vision of foreordination. “Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all 
            these there were many of the noble and great ones … and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These will I make my rulers … Abraham, thou art one of them;

          <p>Mormonism teaches that foreordination applies to all Mormons. Joseph stated, “Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>With a subtle humility, Mormons enjoy hearing how valiant and noble they were in their premortal life. And why not? To be told by men in authority – who claim to speak to God – that you are one of His elite, favored sons and daughters. That you fought to vanquish Satanic forces in the war in heaven. Premortal stories spread through Mormonism like wildfire, tossed into sacrament meeting talks and Sunday school lessons. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>However, sometimes church leaders step in and squash these speculative tales. Case in point, the church released a notice from the First Presidency in 2008. “A statement has been circulated that asserts in part that the youth of the Church today ‘were generals in the war in heaven ... and (someone will) ask you, which of the prophet’s time did you live in? and when you say, Gordon B. Hinckley a hush will fall ... and all in attendance will bow at your presence.’ This is a false statement. It is not Church doctrine.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Where could this “false statement” have come from? The culprit: Brad Wilcox, a member of the Young Men’s General Presidency, at Especially for Youth conferences 
            where he has stated on numerous occasions: “You, the youth of the church today, were generals in the war of Heaven. Someday when you are back in the Spirit World, 
            you will be enthralled by other souls who will be from many other interesting time periods and who lived during the time of many great prophets. You may ask one 
            person, ‘When did you live?’ and hear something like, ‘I was with Moses when he parted the Red Sea,’ or ‘I helped build one of the great pyramids’ or ‘I fought with 
            Captain Moroni.’ And as you are standing there amazed at the people you are with, someone will ask you during which prophets’ time you lived in; when you tell them 
            that you lived during the time of President Kimball, President Benson, President Hunter, and President Hinckley, a hush will fall over every hall and corridor of 
            Heaven and all in attendance will bow in your presence. This is a very important stewardship we have been given. We were held back for 6000 years because we were 
            the most righteous, most talented, most obedient servants of our Heavenly Father.”

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>This is just one of many examples where, in smaller settings, such as youth conferences and stake conferences, the premortal rhetoric is thrown around. Over the years, I’ve heard numerous premortal stories from the pulpit. One of the most famous is a story of a patriarch who gave a blessing to a young man with Down Syndrome. The patriarch claimed that the young man had been among the spirit brothers who escorted Satan out of God’s presence. As Satan was being shown the door, he swore an oath to particularly torment his escorts when they were on earth. This group was blessed to be born into bodies where Satan’s influence could not reach them.

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Although the church has toned down the valiant premortal rhetoric in official settings, such as general conference, it continues to teach that the most valiant 
            spirits in premortality are born in the royal lineage of the House of Israel. It is also taught that the House of Israel existed in premortality. According to 
            an Institute manual, “Israel is an eternal people. Members of that chosen race first gained their inheritance with the faithful in the pre-mortal life.”

          <p>Then, when they are living on the earth under the veil of forgetfulness, when the restored gospel is preached to them, they recognize the truth because of their 
            “believing blood.” Mormon apostle Bruce McConkie defined “believing blood” as “the aptitude and inclination of certain persons to accept and believe the principles 
            of revealed religion … In general, the Lord sends to earth in the lineage of Jacob those spirits who in preexistence developed an especial talent for spirituality 
            and for recognizing truth. Those born in this lineage, having the blood of Israel in their veins, and finding it easy to accept the gospel, are said to have 
            believing blood.”

        <h2 className="headlinePadding">Lineal Right to the Priesthood</h2>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Just as the Jews believed anciently that they were God’s chosen people, Mormons today believe that they are also of the House of Israel and God’s 
            chosen people in the last days. Mormonism is the restoration of the House of Israel. Mormons have been entrusted with the priesthood, and with God’s authority 
            they are to build the Kingdom of God in the latter days to usher in the Second Coming. Joseph Smith taught that Mormons, based on premortal valiance, have a 
            birthright to the priesthood. This gives them the sacred right to preside and rule in the last days. This right comes through Joseph’s and other church leaders’ 
            literal lineage as direct descendants of Abraham, and even Jesus Christ. Yes, the early Mormons believed Jesus was polygamously married and had children. The church has never denounced this teaching, but rather, as with hundreds of other early doctrines, simply doesn’t mention them. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>An 1832 revelation states: “Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers – For ye are 
            lawful heirs, according to the flesh … Therefore, your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the 
            restoration of all things.”

          <p>Brigham Young taught that Joseph was foreordained in premortality to, “… receive the fulness of the keys and power of the Priesthood of the Son of God. 
            The Lord had his eyes upon him, and upon his father, and upon his father’s father, and upon their progenitors, clear back to Abraham, and from Abraham to the 
            flood, from the flood to Enoch, and from Enoch to Adam. He has watched that family and that blood as it has circulated from its fountain to the birth of that man. 
            He was foreordained in eternity to preside over this last dispensation.”

            the “King of all, Seth next, Seth rules under his Father and over all, this process will never end; this is the order of the Kingdom of Heaven, that men should 
            rise up as Kings and Priests of God.”

          <p>So, the Mormon leaders held their offices by birthright – their genealogical line. Joseph and other church leaders considered themselves descendants of Christ

            so many wives; there were Elizabeth, and Mary, and a host of others that followed him ... The grand reason … causing his crucifixion, was evidently based upon 
            polygamy, according to the testimony of the philosophers who rose in that age.”

          <p>Theologian Dr. William Phipps wrote, “… the belief that Jesus married, and married often was used to encourage and promote the doctrine of polygamy amongst timid

          <p>The New and Everlasting Covenant of Marriage is clearly an important doctrine. Its purpose is to create family units that will endure through eternity. 
            According to Mormon belief, the purpose of polygamy was to follow a divine commandment to “raise up seed unto the Lord”

            essentially meaning to increase the Mormon population by having more children. It was justified by referencing biblical figures like Abraham who practiced plural marriage; this practice was seen as a way to achieve greater celestial glory in the afterlife by providing salvation to more women through marriage to a righteous man.

          <p>Mormon apostle Quintin Cook made the following points on polygamy. “First, it’s clear that there was a lot of sacrifice in plural marriages. There was a lot of 
            love and unity … Many of the children of those plural marriages took the gospel of Jesus Christ across the world and blessed many lives … in the senior councils 
            of the Church, there’s a feeling that plural marriage, as it was practiced, served its purpose.”

        <h2 className="headlinePadding">But Were They True Historical Figures?</h2>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Getting back to the Old Testament and the House of Israel. Joseph and the early Mormons believed that the Old Testament figures of Abraham and Sariah, Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob’s 12 sons were real people from the ancient world – God’s chosen people. The Mormons believed, as Joseph taught them, that they were literal descendants of these people. But were these Old Testament people true historical figures? If they are not historical, this presents a huge problem for Mormonism’s truth claims as Joseph taught his followers that they were literal genetic descendants of these Old Testament peoples – testified to in patriarchal blessings. Most Mormons are told in their patriarchal blessings that they are of the tribe of Ephraim, Joseph’s (who was sold into Egypt) second son.

          <p>Unfortunately for Mormonism, the major consensus among biblical scholars is that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the 12 tribes of Israel are not credible historical 
            figures. Their stories are most likely a conjuring of legends, composites of people who may have lived in the 2nd Millennium BCE, used to forge a national identity.

              Scholars believe their stories were not written as eyewitness accounts of historical events but were later inventions written between 538 and 332 BCE by exiled Jews returning to Palestine.

          <p>Based on archaeology and ancient texts, there is a lack of evidence that the patriarchs lived in the Bronze Age (2nd Millennium BCE), as the Bible timeline 
            suggests. Instead, the biblical texts reflect first-Millennium (538 to 332 BCE) conditions and concerns, including names and social milieu. 
            This has led scholars to no longer consider the patriarchal narratives as historical.

            There is also skepticism about whether there ever were twelve 
            Israelite tribes. Scholars have concluded that there never was a fixed number of tribes. Instead, the twelve tribes should be regarded as part of the Israelite 
            national founding myth. The number 12 was not a literal count but an ideal number with symbolic significance in Near Eastern cultures.

          <p>Scholar Paul Davidson stated, “The stories of Jacob and his children, then, are not accounts of historical Bronze Age people. Rather, they tell us how later Jews and Israelites understood themselves, their origins, and their relationship to the land, within the context of folktales that had evolved over time.” Davidson believes that most of the tribal names are “not personal names, but the names of ethnic groups, geographical regions, and local deities. E.g. 
            Benjamin meaning ‘son of the south’ (the location of its territory relative to Samaria) or Asher, a Phoenician territory whose name may be an allusion to the goddess Asherah.”

          <p>How can today’s Mormons be descendants of the House of Israel, specifically the tribe of Ephraim? And how can the Native Americans, or Lamanites, also be descendants of the House of Israel, as well?
