    <h1 className='chapterHeading'>Chapter 15: God’s Favored Sons The House of Israel</h1>

    <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In temples, Mormons are initiated to rule and reign as Kings and Priests, and Queens and Priestesses in the House of Israel forever. Mormons are told in patriarchal blessings that they descend from the House of Israel – most often descendants of the Tribe of Ephraim. Mormons are also taught they were foreordained from before the earth’s creation to be born into this special genealogical Ephraimite line.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Because of this, Mormons believe they inherit the “birthright blessings of the firstborn” from the Tribe of Ephraim. In the Old Testament, Joseph, who was sold into Egypt, inherited the rights of the firstborn to lead the House of Israel. He had two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who also inherited their father’s firstborn rights. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>When told in their patriarchal blessings that they descend from the Tribe of Ephraim, Mormons believe that they are the elect of God, and that it is their life work to build the Kingdom of God in the last days. This is why Mormons refer to themselves as “youth of a noble birthright” as sung in their hymn “Carry On.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>This noble birthright carries sacred responsibilities and obligations. One responsibility is to gather other descendants of the House of Israel into the Mormon church through missionary work. Another responsibility is temple work, sealing the elect of the earth into the family of God through temple ordinances. “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>How the Legend Goes</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph and early Mormons were fascinated by the Jews and the House of Israel, especially Joseph sold into Egypt and his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh. Here is how the legend unfolds. In the Old Testament, when Abraham was 99 years old, God appeared to him and said, “I am the Almighty God … I will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly … thou shalt be a father of many nations.”  This made Abraham the head of God’s covenant family on earth.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>But Abraham was puzzled. He had no heir – no sons. Then, miraculously, Abraham and Sarah conceived Isaac. Isaac had two sons, Jacob and Esau. Jacob, as the firstborn, was given the priestly birthright to rule over his people – the covenant family of God. This right is known as “office of firstborn” and would be passed from father to eldest son down through the generations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>As with Abraham, God appeared to Jacob and said, “… thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name … be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.”  Therefore, Abraham was on his way to becoming a “father of many nations” through the posterity of Jacob, renamed Israel.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Next in the legend, Jacob had 12 sons from his two wives, Leah and Rachel, and his two concubines, Zilpah and Bilhah. But then, a twist. Jacob’s firstborn son, Reuben, forfeited the “office of firstborn” by transgression. He slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah. The “office of firstborn” fell upon Joseph, Rachel’s firstborn son, and he became the favored son and received elevated status. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph had two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. This created the House of Joseph. As was the custom, Joseph brought his sons to his father, Jacob, for blessings. With his two grandsons kneeling before him, the aged Jacob placed his left hand upon the firstborn Manasseh, and his right hand upon the second born Ephraim. Joseph assumed his father had mistaken the birth order and had switched his hands. But Jacob stopped Joseph saying, “I know it: he (Manasseh) also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother (Ephraim) shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.”  
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>So, through revelation from God to Jacob, the prophet and head of the House of Israel, the “office of firstborn” fell to the second-born Ephraim  – whom Mormons claim they descend from their patriarchal blessings. Before his death, Jacob called his 12 sons together for blessings. Jacob blessed Joseph and his posterity with the priestly “office of firstborn” to build and rule over the House of Israel – the nation of Israel, which consisted of 12 tribes. Jacob bestowed the “kingly office” upon Judah and blessed him with a kingly scepter. Judah and his posterity were to serve as kings over the House of Israel. “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise … The sceptre shall not depart from Judah.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Therefore, Jacob’s blessings divided the House of Israel into two parts – with “kingship” going to the House of Judah, and the “office of firstborn” and the priestly right to rule and lead the House of Israel going to the House of Joseph. Whereas Judah and his descendants would be seated on the throne as kings, Ephraim would be responsible for building and administering the kingdom, holding together a group of mighty nations, and gathering in the elect of the earth – God’s most righteous sons and daughters.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>According to Joseph Smith, in the latter days, all descendants of Israel’s tribes – including the Lost Ten Tribes – will gather to Zion, Jackson County, through the efforts of Ephraim (Mormons) and receive their promised blessings. Joseph revealed, “And there shall they (Lost Ten Tribes) fall down and be crowned with glory, even in Zion (Jackson County), by the hands of the servants of the Lord, even the children of Ephraim. And they shall be filled with songs of everlasting joy. Behold, this is the blessing of the everlasting God upon the tribes of Israel, and the richer blessing upon the head of Ephraim and his fellows. And they also of the tribe of Judah (the Jews), after their pain (captivity and exile) shall be sanctified in holiness before the Lord to dwell in his presence day and night, forever and ever.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Today’s Descendants of Ephraim (Mormons)</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In the Old Testament, Jacob prophesies that his son “Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall.”  The “fruitful bough” refers to Joseph’s numerous posterities, through Ephraim and Manasseh. Mormons believe the wall is the ocean that separates the old world of Palestine from America, and that Joseph’s posterity would inhabit America and become the Book of Mormon people of Nephites and Lamanites.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Mormons also believe that others of Joseph’s descendants were scattered when the Assyrians sacked the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 721 BCE, forming the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel. Ephraim and Manasseh were two of the Ten Lost Tribes. Mormons believe that over the centuries, these people made their way into Europe and Scandinavia. Being from the House of Israel, the message of Joseph Smith’s restored gospel was familiar to them, and they accepted it through baptism.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Mormon general authority Orson Whitney stated, “Why did the Savior say, ‘My sheep know my voice?’ Did the sheep ever know the voice of a shepherd it had never heard before? They who love the truth, and to whom it most strongly appeals, were they not acquainted with it in a previous life? I think so. I believe we knew the Gospel before we came here.”  Sixth Mormon prophet Joseph F. Smith said, “… we often catch a spark from the awakened memories of the immortal soul, which lights up our whole being as with the glory of our former home.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>When the first British stake was organized, Mormon prophet Spencer Kimball visited Malvern Hills in England and declared, “This is a place where the blood of Israel is richly concentrated, and there are many still to gather.”  Later, Mormon prophet Harold Lee testified in Manchester England that a temple had been built in Great Britain “because of its great contribution to the early and continuous growth of the Church, which gave evidence to the great outpouring of the blood of Israel among the people of these great British Isles.”  Mormon general authority Derek Cuthbert proclaimed that “these [British] islands have a divine destiny ... Yes, the blood of Israel is richly concentrated in these islands and the promised blessings will all be fulfilled.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>This idea is not unique to Mormonism. British Israelism, or Anglo Israelism, was the belief that the peoples of Northern European nations were descended from the lost Ten Tribes of Israel who migrated there after Assyria conquered Israel in 721 B.C. One of the early sources of this idea came from the French magistrate M. le Loyer’s The Ten Lost Tribes, published in 1590. Loyer provided one of the earliest statements of the belief that the Anglo Saxon, Celtic, Scandinavian, Germanic, and associated peoples are the direct descendants of the Old Testament Israelites.  Over time, other books and sermons promoted the idea that the lost Ten Tribes of Israel, and the Jews after the Romans sacked Jerusalem in 70 A.D., migrated throughout Europe to Great Britain. As a result, the bloodlines of Israel were scattered through the European nations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>However, the truth rings a little differently. The fact is that Europeans are a mishmash of ancient migrations. DNA studies show that almost all indigenous Europeans descend from at least three major migrations. The first migration started with hunter-gatherers who came from the Middle East as the glaciers receded between 19,000 and 14,000 years ago. In a second migration, about 9,000 years ago, farmers from northwestern Anatolia (now Greece and Turkey) moved in. The third major migration began about 5,000 years ago when herders swept in from the Black Sea in what is now Russia. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Nonetheless, Mormon leaders continue to teach the false idea that the British Isles were populated by descendants of the favored tribe of Ephraim from the house of Israel. They use this to explain why European people, especially those in the British Isles, joined the church in high numbers when the first Mormon missionaries arrived in the late 1830s.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Adoption into the House of Israel</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>If a Mormon does not descend from the lineage of the House of Israel, they may be adopted into the House of Israel. Joseph contrasted the experience of a true descendant of the House of Israel and a Gentile when receiving the Holy Ghost by the gift of the laying on of hands. Joseph taught “… [when] the Holy Ghost falls upon one of the literal seed of Abraham, it is calm and serene; and his whole soul and body are only exercised by the pure spirit of intelligence.” But with a Gentile, “the effect of the Holy Ghost upon a Gentile, is to purge out the old blood, and make him actually of the seed of Abraham.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>According to Brigham Young, Joseph taught that when a Gentile is confirmed a member of the church that “When the Lord pours out the Holy Ghost upon that individual, he will have spasms, and you would think that he was going into fits.”  Brigham also said that Joseph taught that the Gentile blood was actually cleansed out of their veins, and the blood of Jacob made to circulate in them; and the revolution and change in the system were so great that it caused the beholder to think they were going into fits.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>If the genetic makeup changes racially, that Mormon convert’s children would be of Israelite lineage. But regardless, whether a person is an Israelites either by blood (lineage) or adoption, once they are baptized, they become a member of the Mormon House of Israel. They then belong to the eternal family of the Old Testament patriarchs Abraham and Jacob.  These family ties are eternal and last beyond this mortal life. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Shadowy Past of the Premortal World</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>But let’s start at the beginning, your very beginning – in shadowy pasts of the premortal world. Mormonism teaches that among Heavenly Father’s spirit children in the premortal worlds, there was a group of valiant, elite, “noble and great” spirits.  If you are a Mormon, in the premortal world you were among the elite children of God. You were reserved to come to this earth in the last days. You were destined to undertake the heavy lifting of building Zion – the Kingdom of God – and preparing the world for the Second Coming. In this premortal world, you were set apart to receive specific callings in your mortal life. You were to be raised in the privileged circumstances of a Mormon home in the Abrahamic covenant. Here you were to flourish living under the restored gospel.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Thirteenth Mormon prophet Ezra Benson taught, “You have been born at this time for a sacred and glorious purpose … Your birth was foreordained in the eternities. You are to be ‘the royal army of the Lord in the last days.’ You are youth of the noble birthright.”  Sixth Mormon prophet Joseph F. Smith, revealed, “Even before they were born, they, with many others, received their first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>A church pamphlet, True to the Faith, states, “In the premortal spirit world, God appointed certain spirits to fulfill specific missions during their mortal lives. This is called foreordination … Such opportunities come in this life as a result of the righteous exercise of agency … in the premortal existence.”  Joseph revealed a vision of foreordination. “Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones … and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These will I make my rulers … Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou was born.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Mormonism teaches that foreordination applies to all Mormons. Joseph stated, “Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the grand council of heaven before the world was. I suppose I was ordained to this very office in that grand council.”  Mormon apostle Neal Maxwell said, “It was by divine design that the marvelous Mary became the mother of Jesus. Further, Lucy Mack Smith, who played such a crucial role in the rearing of Joseph Smith, did not come to that assignment by chance.”  
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In the Book of Mormon, Alma taught that all who are ordained High Priests in the Melchizedek Priesthood in mortality were foreordained to that office in the premortal world. Mormon apostle Bruce McConkie stated, “every person who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood was foreordained to receive that high and holy order in the pre-existent councils of eternity.”  Alma wrote, “And this is the manner after which they were ordained – being called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works … and exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling, which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>With a subtle humility, Mormons enjoy hearing how valiant and noble they were in their premortal life. And why not? To be told by men in authority – who claim to speak to God – that you are one of His elite, favored sons and daughters. That you fought to vanquish Satanic forces in the war in heaven. Premortal stories spread through Mormonism like wildfire, tossed into sacrament meeting talks and Sunday school lessons. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>However, sometimes church leaders step in and squash these speculative tales. Case in point, the church released a notice from the First Presidency in 2008. “A statement has been circulated that asserts in part that the youth of the Church today ‘were generals in the war in heaven ... and (someone will) ask you, which of the prophet’s time did you live in? and when you say, Gordon B. Hinckley a hush will fall ... and all in attendance will bow at your presence.’ This is a false statement. It is not Church doctrine.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Where could this “false statement” have come from? The culprit: Brad Wilcox, a member of the Young Men’s General Presidency, at Especially for Youth conferences where he has stated on numerous occasions: "You, the youth of the church today, were generals in the war of Heaven. Someday when you are back in the Spirit World, you will be enthralled by other souls who will be from many other interesting time periods and who lived during the time of many great prophets. You may ask one person, ‘When did you live?’ and hear something like, ‘I was with Moses when he parted the Red Sea,’ or ‘I helped build one of the great pyramids’ or ‘I fought with Captain Moroni.’ And as you are standing there amazed at the people you are with, someone will ask you during which prophets’ time you lived in; when you tell them that you lived during the time of President Kimball, President Benson, President Hunter, and President Hinckley, a hush will fall over every hall and corridor of Heaven and all in attendance will bow in your presence. This is a very important stewardship we have been given. We were held back for 6000 years because we were the most righteous, most talented, most obedient servants of our Heavenly Father.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>This is just one of many examples where, in smaller settings, such as youth conferences and stake conferences, the premortal rhetoric is thrown around. Over the years, I’ve heard numerous premortal stories from the pulpit. One of the most famous is a story of a patriarch who gave a blessing to a young man with Down Syndrome. The patriarch claimed that the young man had been among the spirit brothers who escorted Satan out of God’s presence. As Satan was being shown the door, he swore an oath to particularly torment his escorts when they were on earth. This group was blessed to be born into bodies where Satan’s influence could not reach them. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Although the church has toned down the valiant premortal rhetoric in official settings, such as general conference, it continues to teach that the most valiant spirits in premortality are born in the royal lineage of the House of Israel. It is also taught that the House of Israel existed in premortality. According to an Institute manual, “Israel is an eternal people. Members of that chosen race first gained their inheritance with the faithful in the pre-mortal life.”  
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Then, when they are living on the earth under the veil of forgetfulness, when the restored gospel is preached to them, they recognize the truth because of their “believing blood.” Mormon apostle Bruce McConkie defined “believing blood” as “the aptitude and inclination of certain persons to accept and believe the principles of revealed religion … In general, the Lord sends to earth in the lineage of Jacob those spirits who in preexistence developed an especial talent for spirituality and for recognizing truth. Those born in this lineage, having the blood of Israel in their veins, and finding it easy to accept the gospel, are said to have believing blood.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Lineal Right to the Priesthood</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Just as the Jews believed anciently that they were God’s chosen people, Mormons today believe that they are also of the House of Israel and God’s chosen people in the last days. Mormonism is the restoration of the House of Israel. Mormons have been entrusted with the priesthood, and with God’s authority they are to build the Kingdom of God in the latter days to usher in the Second Coming. Joseph Smith taught that Mormons, based on premortal valiance, have a birthright to the priesthood. This gives them the sacred right to preside and rule in the last days. This right comes through Joseph’s and other church leaders’ literal lineage as direct descendants of Abraham, and even Jesus Christ. Yes, the early Mormons believed Jesus was polygamously married and had children. The church has never denounced this teaching, but rather, as with hundreds of other early doctrines, simply doesn’t mention them. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>An 1832 revelation states: “Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers – For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh … Therefore, your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things.”  This revelation only scratches the surface about the Mormons’ belief in their right to rule based on their belief they are descendants of the House of Israel.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Brigham Young taught that Joseph was foreordained in premortality to, “… receive the fulness of the keys and power of the Priesthood of the Son of God. The Lord had his eyes upon him, and upon his father, and upon his father’s father, and upon their progenitors, clear back to Abraham, and from Abraham to the flood, from the flood to Enoch, and from Enoch to Adam. He has watched that family and that blood as it has circulated from its fountain to the birth of that man. He was foreordained in eternity to preside over this last dispensation.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Referring to other church leaders, First Presidency Counselor Heber Kimball taught, “Now, I will refer to brother Brigham, brother Heber, brother Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, Bishop N. K. Whitney, and lots of other men. Brother Joseph actually saw those men in vision ... We have been separated by marriage and thrown apart; but he saw the day when we all came out of one stock, and that was out of the aristocracy. Yes, we came directly down through the Prophets, and not only us, but … the whole Smith race.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>On another occasion, Heber spoke of his right of dominion through his lineage. “Did you actually know Joseph Smith? No. Do you know brother Brigham? No. Do you know brother Heber? No, you do not. Do you know the Twelve? You do not, if you did, you would begin to know God and learn that those men who are chosen to direct and counsel you are near kindred to God and to Jesus Christ, for the keys, power, and authority of the kingdom of God are in that lineage.”  Kindred is defined as one’s lineage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Heber Kimball declared that both he and Brigham Young were “both heirs to the priesthood. How did we know it? Jos. had a vision and saw and traced back our bloods to the royal family.”  On January 8, 1845, Brigham Young declared that the Youngs, Kimballs, Smiths and several other families were “all in one family.” He further stated that Joseph Smith’s blood “was pure in him and that is why the Lord chose him ... That blood was in him pure and he had the sole right and lawful power, and he was legal heir to the blood that has been on the Earth.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Brigham stated the following regarding the proper organizing of heaven and earth. “I will shew you the order of the Kingdom – one is placed here, another there, another there, and so on – I should be their ruler, savior, dictator & governor – they would have an innumerable posterity and say just as I say.” Adam was to be the “King of all, Seth next, Seth rules under his Father and over all, this process will never end; this is the order of the Kingdom of Heaven, that men should rise up as Kings and Priests of God.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>So, the Mormon leaders held their offices by birthright – their genealogical line. Joseph and other church leaders considered themselves descendants of Christ and of the lineage of the House of Israel.  From his birthright and office, Joseph, at the top of the heap, held prophetic, kingly, and priestly authority needed to restore the theocratic Kingdom of God on earth necessary to usher in the Second Coming.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Family of God and Polygamy</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In 1852, the Mormon church officially announced to the world that it practiced polygamy, and that it was essential for exaltation. According to Joseph Smith’s personal secretary, “... [Joseph Smith taught] the doctrine of plural and celestial marriage is the most holy and important doctrine ever revealed to man on the earth, and that without obedience to that principle no man can ever attain to the fullness of exaltation in the celestial glory.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Early Mormon Mosiah Hancock recorded, “As early as Spring of 1832 Bro. Joseph said ‘Brother Levi [Mosiah’s father], the Lord has revealed to me that it is his will that righteous men shall take Righteous women even a plurality of Wives that a Righteous race may be sent forth upon the Earth preparatory to the ushering in of the Millennial Reign of our Redeemer – For the Lord has such a high respect for the nobles of his kingdom that he is not willing for them to come through the Loins of a Careless People – Therefore; it behooves those who embrace that Principle to pay strict attention to even the Least requirement of our Heavenly Father.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>This “righteous race” includes bringing valiant spirits that are part of the House of Israel from the premortal world to be born into Mormon homes in the later day. The early Mormons were taught that polygamy was God’s vehicle for bringing this to pass – regardless of the level of personal sacrifice. The reward for a polygamist was exaltation.
          </p>

          <p>Brigham Young stated, “The only men who become Gods, even the Sons of God, are those who enter into polygamy.”   The Deseret News published in 1873, “Now, where a man in this church says, ‘I don’t want but one wife, I will live my religion with one.’ He will perhaps be saved in the Celestial Kingdom; but when he gets there, he will not find himself in possession of any wife at all ... and he will remain single forever and ever.”  Brigham also taught, “[A] man who did not have but one wife in the Resurrection that woman will not be his but [be] taken from him & given to another.”

          <p>Early Mormon prophets taught that both God the Father and Jesus Christ are polygamously married in the New and Everlasting Covenant of marriage. Mormon apostle Orson Pratt wrote, “We have now clearly shown that God the Father had a plurality of wives.” Then speaking of Mary, the earthly mother of Jesus, Orson stated, “Inasmuch as God was the first husband to her, it may be that He only gave her to be the wife of Joseph while in this mortal state, and that He intended after the resurrection to again take her as one of his wives to raise up immortal spirits in eternity.”

          <p>Mormon apostle Orson Hyde taught that “Jesus Christ was married at Cana of Galilee, that Mary, Martha, and others were his wives, and that he begat children.”  First Presidency Counselor Jedediah Grant taught “The grand reason why the Gentiles and philosophers of his school persecuted Jesus Christ, was, because he had so many wives; there were Elizabeth, and Mary, and a host of others that followed him ... The grand reason … causing his crucifixion, was evidently based upon polygamy, according to the testimony of the philosophers who rose in that age.”

          <p>Theologian Dr. William Phipps wrote, “… the belief that Jesus married, and married often was used to encourage and promote the doctrine of polygamy amongst timid Latter-Day Saints ... By the late-1850s the idea that more than one woman was married to Jesus was widely accepted among Mormon circles.”

          <p>The New and Everlasting Covenant of Marriage is clearly an important doctrine. Its purpose is to create family units that will endure through eternity. According to Mormon belief, the purpose of polygamy was to follow a divine commandment to “raise up seed unto the Lord”  essentially meaning to increase the Mormon population by having more children. It was justified by referencing biblical figures like Abraham who practiced plural marriage; this practice was seen as a way to achieve greater celestial glory in the afterlife by providing salvation to more women through marriage to a righteous man.

          <p>Mormons are taught that there are multitudes of pure spirits waiting to take bodies. Brigham Young stated, “the doctrine of plurality of wives was revealed (so that) the noble spirits which are waiting for tabernacles might be brought forth.”  The most noble spirits are to be sent to Mormon homes.

          <p>Mormon apostle Quintin Cook made the following points on polygamy. “First, it’s clear that there was a lot of sacrifice in plural marriages. There was a lot of love and unity … Many of the children of those plural marriages took the gospel of Jesus Christ across the world and blessed many lives … in the senior councils of the Church, there’s a feeling that plural marriage, as it was practiced, served its purpose.”

        <h3>But Were They True Historical Figures?</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Getting back to the Old Testament and the House of Israel. Joseph and the early Mormons believed that the Old Testament figures of Abraham and Sariah, Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob’s 12 sons were real people from the ancient world – God’s chosen people. The Mormons believed, as Joseph taught them, that they were literal descendants of these people. But were these Old Testament people true historical figures? If they are not historical, this presents a huge problem for Mormonism’s truth claims as Joseph taught his followers that they were literal genetic descendants of these Old Testament peoples – testified to in patriarchal blessings. Most Mormons are told in their patriarchal blessings that they are of the tribe of Ephraim, Joseph’s (who was sold into Egypt) second son.

          <p>Unfortunately for Mormonism, the major consensus among biblical scholars is that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the 12 tribes of Israel are not credible historical figures. Their stories are most likely a conjuring of legends, composites of people who may have lived in the 2nd Millennium BCE, used to forge a national identity.  Scholars believe their stories were not written as eyewitness accounts of historical events but were later inventions written between 538 and 332 BCE by exiled Jews returning to Palestine.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Based on archaeology and ancient texts, there is a lack of evidence that the patriarchs lived in the Bronze Age (2nd Millennium BCE), as the Bible timeline suggests. Instead, the biblical texts reflect first-Millennium (538 to 332 BCE) conditions and concerns, including names and social milieu. This has led scholars to no longer consider the patriarchal narratives as historical.  There is also skepticism about whether there ever were twelve Israelite tribes. Scholars have concluded that there never was a fixed number of tribes. Instead, the twelve tribes should be regarded as part of the Israelite national founding myth. The number 12 was not a literal count but an ideal number with symbolic significance in Near Eastern cultures.

          <p>Scholar Paul Davidson stated, “The stories of Jacob and his children, then, are not accounts of historical Bronze Age people. Rather, they tell us how later Jews and Israelites understood themselves, their origins, and their relationship to the land, within the context of folktales that had evolved over time.” Davidson believes that most of the tribal names are “not personal names, but the names of ethnic groups, geographical regions, and local deities. E.g. Benjamin meaning “son of the south” (the location of its territory relative to Samaria) or Asher, a Phoenician territory whose name may be an allusion to the goddess Asherah.”

          <p>How can today’s Mormons be descendants of the House of Israel, specifically the tribe of Ephraim? And how can the Native Americans, or Lamanites, also be descendants of the House of Israel, as well?
