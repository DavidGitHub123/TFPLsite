    <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The long-awaited day had arrived! The Book of Mormon had been published. It was time for Book of Mormon prophecy to be fulfilled. The Lamanites would have the knowledge of their identity as of the House of Israel restored. They would be taught the restored gospel and learn of God’s directive that it was their mission to build the holy city of Zion, the New Jerusalem in the last days.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In his early years, Joseph may have been influenced by Hyrum, his older brother, about missionary work among the Lamanites. From 1811 to 1815 (ages 11 to 15) 
            Hyrum attended Moors Academy, a prep school for Dartmouth College. The college was founded in 1754 by a Puritan Calvinist minister to educate Native Americans 
            who desired to be Christian missionaries to the native tribes.

              Both Dartmouth and Moors Academy taught that the Native Americans were of Israelite descent.

          <p>One of Joseph’s first actions after the church was organized was to send missionaries to the Lamanites. After all, fulfilling this was one of the purposes of 
            the Book of Mormon. Joseph revealed Christ’s words in September 1830 to “… go among the Lamanites and preach my gospel unto them.”

            In the same revelation, Zion’s location was not specified, only that it was “on the borders by the Lamanites,”

            across the Missouri border in Indian territory.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Native Americans had been pushed to the western boundary of the United States. They were living in reservations on the border of Missouri due to the Indian Removal Act of 1830. To the Mormons this was fortuitous timing. Surely, this was God’s doing in pushing the Native Americans, a lost remnant of the House of Israel, into a concentrated location where they could hear the restored gospel. The Mormons were not alone in their desire to convert Native Americans. Other Christian missionaries had gathered in Missouri to seize the opportunity to proselytize the Native Americans, this lost remnant of the House of Israel in order to win converts.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The Mormon newspaper The Evening and The Morning Star reported in 1832, quoting Isaiah, “It is not only gratifying, but almost marvelous, 
            to witness the gathering of the Indians. The work has been going on for some time, and these remnants of Joseph (the Native Americans) 
            gather by hundreds to settle west of the Missouri and Arkansas. And is not this scripture fulfilling, ‘Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, 
            thou that leadest Joseph like a flock’ and through the instrumentality of the government of the United States? For it is written, 
            Behold I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and 
            thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.’ Thus … there is reason to rejoice that the great purposes of the Lord are 
            fulfilling before our eyes.”

          <p>In October 1830, Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, Parley Pratt, and Ziba Peterson made a covenant to preach to the Native Americans and 
            departed later that month.

            The missionaries must have been excited. They must have recollected the verses of the Book of Mormon, “And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them; 
            wherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their fathers, and also to the knowledge of Jesus Christ … and their scales of darkness shall begin to 
            fall from their eyes.”

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>These four missionaries must have anticipated seeing ancient prophecies fulfilled regarding the House of Israel. They would see the results of the hand of God who caused great migrations of the Old Testament Joseph’s descendants “as a fruitful bough” crossing the ocean to become Nephites and Lamanites in the New World. With eagerness, these missionaries must have looked to the moment with reverence that their message would ring true and familiar to these Lamanites with the blood of Israel coursing through their veins. In great numbers the Native Americans would accept their message of Mormonism and began to build Zion so Christ could come again.

          <p>But the missionaries met little to no success – the exact opposite of what Joseph’s revelations and the Book of Mormon promised. The missionaries first 
            encountered the Seneca. Parley wrote that they met with “an Indian nation at or near Buffalo [New York].”

            But there were no baptisms. The missionaries left copies of the Book of Mormon, but those Native Americans did not embrace the restored gospel.

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The missionaries next traveled to Kirtland, Ohio. There, Parley met with his friend Sidney Rigdon a Reformed Baptist preacher. Sidney and his adherents accepted 
            Mormonism. Parley recorded, “in two or three weeks from arrival in the neighborhood … we had baptized one hundred and twenty-seven souls, and this number soon 
            increased to one thousand.”

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In November 1830, the missionaries reached their second group of Native Americans in the upper Sandusky River region. Parley records the Wyandots received the missionaries with kindness but doesn’t mention any baptisms. Next, the missionaries traveled to Missouri, arriving in Independence on January 13, 1831. They soon realized that missionary work by other Christian denominations was underway among the Native Americans there.

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The missionaries first met with the Shawnee but stayed only one night. The next day, they made their way to a settlement of the Delaware Tribe. The Delaware Chief treated them kindly, giving them both rest and food. After eating, the missionaries relayed their message of the Book of Mormon by way of an interpreter. Oliver Cowdery stated, “Aged Chief and Venerable Council of the Delaware Nation; we are glad of this opportunity to address you as our red brethren and friends. We have travelled a long distance from towards the rising sun to bring you glad news … to communicate to you great knowledge … which will do the red man good as well as the pale face.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Oliver told of the Book of Mormon narrative and how America was given to the Lamanites as a land of inheritance: “Once the red men were many; they occupied the country from sea to sea – from the rising to the setting sun; the whole land was theirs; the Great Spirit gave it to them, and no pale faces dwelt among them. But now they are few in numbers; their possessions are small, and the pale faces are many. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“Thousands of moons ago, when the red men’s forefathers dwelt in peace and possessed this whole land, the Great Spirit talked with them, and revealed His law and His will, and much knowledge to their wise men and prophets. This they wrote in a Book; together with their history, and the things which should befall their children in the latter days. This Book [of Mormon] was written on plates of gold and handed down from father to son for many ages and generations. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“It was then that the people prospered and were strong and mighty; they cultivated the earth; built buildings and cities, and abounded in all good things, as the pale faces now do. But they became wicked; they killed one another and shed much blood; they killed their prophets and wise men and sought to destroy the Book. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“The Great Spirit became angry and would speak to them no more; they had no more good and wise dreams; no more visions; no more angels sent among them by the Great Spirit; and the Lord commanded Mormon and Moroni, their last wise men and prophets, to hide the Book [of Mormon] in the earth, that it might be preserved in safety, and be found and made known in the latter day to the pale faces who should possess the land.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“… if the red man would then receive this Book [of Mormon] and learn the things written in it, and do according thereunto, they should cease to fight and kill one another; should become one people; cultivate the earth in peace, in common with the pale faces, who were willing to believe and obey the same Book [of Mormon] and be good men and live in peace. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“… The Book [of Mormon], which contained these things, was hid in the earth by Moroni, in a hill called by him, Cumorah, which hill is now in the State of New York, near the village of Palmyra, in Ontario County. In that neighborhood there lived a young man named Joseph Smith, who prayed to the Great Spirit much, in order that he might know the truth; and the Great Spirit sent an angel to him and told him where this Book [of Mormon] was hid by Moroni; and commanded him to go and get it. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“He accordingly went to the place, and dug in the earth, and found the Book [of Mormon] written on gold plates. But it was written in the language of the 
            forefathers of the red man; therefore, this young man, being a pale face, could not understand it; but the angel told him and showed him, and gave him knowledge 
            of the language, and how to interpret the Book [of Mormon]. So, he interpreted it into the language of the pale faces, and wrote it on paper, and caused it to be 
            printed, and published thousands of copies of among them; and then sent us to the red men to bring some copies of it to them, and to tell them this news.”

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>A Book of Mormon was presented to the chief. He stated that he was glad to hear their message, “especially this new news concerning the Book of our forefathers.”

            He invited the missionaries to come again in the spring to continue teaching the Delaware and allowed them to stay among the Delaware for a few days. According to 
            Parley, the missionaries were able to continue teaching the Delaware and that “interest became more and more intense on their [the Delaware’s] part… until at 
            length nearly the whole tribe began to feel a spirit of inquiry and excitement on the subject … and took great pains to tell the news to others, in their own 
            language.”

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>But a “spirit of inquiry” is different from accepting Mormon baptism and being inspired to build the holy city of Zion, the New Jerusalem. Pratt does not indicate that any Delaware were baptized.

        <h2 className="headlinePadding">The End of the Lamanite Mission</h2>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Trouble was on the horizon. News of the missionaries entering Indian Territory and preaching among the Native Americans reached the local Indian agent. The Mormons had failed to acquire the necessary legal license to proselytize in Indian Territory. The agent ordered the missionaries out of Indian Territory immediately, threatening them with removal by force.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Given the centuries of prophecy and anticipation, one would think that God would have inspired the four missionaries to obtain a license! As Mormons always do, 
            they played the blame game with the persecution narrative. Parley blamed their ejection on the “jealousy and envy of the Indian agents and sectarian missionaries.” 
            Oliver wrote a few months later that “almost the whole country which consists of Universalists Atheists Deists Presbyterians Methodists Baptists & professed 
            Christians Priests & people with all the Devils from the infernal pit are united against the Mormons.”

          <p>“A few days ago three Men all Strangers to me went among the Indians Shawnees & Delawares, they say for the purpose of preaching to and Instructing them in

            was shown to one of their Sects in a Miraculous way, and that an Angel from Heaven appeared to one of their Men and two others of their Sect, and shewed them 
            that the work was from God, and much more &c. I have refused to let them stay or, go among the Indians unless they first obtain permission from you or, some of

            then they will go to the Rocky Mountains, but what they will be with the Indians. The Men act very strange; there came on five to this place, they say, four from

          <p>After receiving no reply, the missionaries returned to Missouri, effectively bringing the Lamanite mission to an end. If it were God’s purpose to bring the 
            Lamanites to a knowledge of their Redeemer and restore them to their covenants as the house of Israel to build the holy city of Zion, surely the Lord would 
            open the way for a successful Mormon missionary program to the Lamanites. After all, the promises of the Lord cannot be broken. If the Book of Mormon were true, 
            these Native Americans would gladly and in great multitudes, have accepted the gospel as Mormon scriptures prophesied and become a white and delightsome people.
