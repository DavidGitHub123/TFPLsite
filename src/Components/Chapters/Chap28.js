          <p>From its beginning, Mormonism claimed a special relationship with Native Americans. Joseph Smith preached that they would 
            undergo a mighty transformation that would foreshadow the Second Coming. Joseph revealed in 1831, “Before the great day of 
            the Lord shall come, Jacob shall flourish in the wilderness, and the Lamanites shall blossom as the rose.”

            W.W. Phelps wrote, “The Indians are the people of the Lord; they are of the tribes of Israel; the blood of Joseph, with a small mixture of 
            the royal blood of Judah, and the hour is nigh when they will come flocking into the kingdom of God, like doves to their windows.”

          <p>In 1845, the Mormon apostles proclaimed to the world, “They will also come to the knowledge of their forefathers, and of the fulness of the 
            gospel; and they will embrace it and become a righteous branch of the house of Israel.”              
            Their proclamation continued, “The despised and degraded son of the forest … [shall] stand forth in manly dignity, and exclaim to the 
            Gentiles … I live, and am heir to the inheritance, titles, honors, priesthood, sceptre, crown, throne, and eternal life and dignity of my 
            fathers, who live for evermore.” The Mormon apostles also stated, “He shall then be ordained, washed, anointed with holy oil, and arrayed 
            in fine linen, even in the glorious and beautiful garments and royal robes of the high priesthood … [and] shall enter into the congregation 
            of the Lord, even into the Holy of Holies, there to be crowned with authority and power which shall never end.”

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The Book of Mormon also states that descendants of the tribe of Ephraim (Mormons) would emerge in the last days as Gentiles to serve as

            Borrowing a phrase from Isaiah, the Book of Mormon prophesies “Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, … 
            and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders. And kings shall be thy nursing fathers,

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>For thousands of years, Native American tribes occupied the Great Basin of Utah – predating the Book of Mormon narrative by several 
            millennia. In 1847, when the first Mormons arrived, five major tribes –the Utes, Paiutes, Goshutes, Shoshone, and Navajo – were 
            living in Utah,

            By 1860 the Mormon population had risen to 40,000. Within another ten years, 86,000 Mormons were living in Utah. In 50 years of Mormon settlement, 
            at the dawn of the 20th century, Utah’s Native American population dwindled from 20,000 to 2,700, a decline of 86%.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The first few years of Mormon settlement were generally peaceful. The Mormons did many good things for the Native Americans. Brigham’s initial policy was that it is better and cheaper to feed the Native Americans than fight them. Mormons established missions to help the Native Americans develop a new economic base of agriculture. This would help them move away from their hunter/gatherer existence. Missionaries stationed at each mission attempted to teach the Native Americans how to read and write.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In 1850, Brigham reassured Native American leaders that Mormons and the tribes would become allies, as “Our Father the Great 
            Spirit has plenty of land for you and for the Mormons.”

            But one year later, Mormon apostle George Smith petitioned Congress and U.S. President Fillmore to extinguish Indian title to the 
            territory and to “provide measures for the removal of Indians from Utah.”

            Brigham assuredly was aware of this request as Mormon prophet.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>For centuries, Native Americans had survived the harsh environmental conditions of Utah. But Mormon colonization was too much, quickly destroying their way of life. As the Mormon kingdom expanded, Native Americans were pushed out of their foraging and hunting areas. Because the Mormons didn’t understand proper grazing techniques and agricultural irrigation, they destroyed the land in many instances. This led to the starvation of many Native Americans. To survive, the Native Americans stole Mormon livestock, igniting a tinderbox.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Believing they had a divine mandate to possess the land, the Mormons refused to accept the Native American’s right to inhabit the Great 
            Basin they had occupied for centuries. Brigham taught that the land was owned by God. Members must “be industrious and take care of it” 
            since “the Lord has given it to us without price.”

            Mormon leader Thomas Bullock stated, “We have found a place where the land is acknowledged to belong unto the Lord, and the Saints being his 
            people, are entitled to as much as they can plant, take care of, and will sustain their families with food.”

            As a result, Mormon settlements were made on Native American hunting grounds and the graves of their fathers.

          <p>Theft of livestock was a point of contention. There were so many Mormon cattle in some regions that they could not be responsibly cared for, 
            with Brigham noting that “the way stock dies through neglect is a sin that will lie at the door of this people.”

            This made no sense to Native Americans, particularly when Mormon settlers said they had no food to assist them. To the Native Americans, land, cattle and other resources were communally owned. If there were extra cattle, they would be distributed among people who needed them. Taking extra cattle that would have died anyway to eat was not considered theft by different tribes.

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>However, when cattle were stolen, Mormon settlers tried to retrieve their cattle by force, leading to deaths on both sides. Brigham reminded settlers of his 
            policy that it was cheaper to feed the Native Americans than to fight them. Brigham sent a letter to Mormons in central Utah which stated, “We have learned the 
            brethren of Sanpete and up the Sevier are much exasperated against the Indians … and feel like slaughtering them indiscriminately… Such a course would be most 
            injudicious and cruel.”

          <p>Brigham taught that cursed racial lineages were in a three-tiered class of redemption. The Lamanites (Native Americans) were on top. The Jewish people were in the 
            middle. Cain’s descendants (Black people) were on the bottom. Each class corresponded to the time when they would each receive the gospel, “with Native Americans 
            in the foreseeable future, Jewish people after they were gathered at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, and Black people in the afterlife during the resurrection.”

          <p>Given Brigham’s racist views, he institutionalized slavery in Utah in 1852. The law stated that Native American slaves could be held up to twenty years in 
            indentured servitude. Children between seven and sixteen years old were to be sent to school for three months of the year but were otherwise put to work.

          <p>At Circleville, 26 Paiutes were bound and placed in the Mormon meeting house. Two captives cut themselves loose and attempted to escape but were shot by guards. 
            The remaining prisoners were then moved to an underground cellar. The Paiutes were eventually led out of the cellar. The Mormons struck them on the back of their 
            heads to stun them, then slit their throats, leaving them to bleed to death.

          <p>The Circleville Massacre is remembered as follows in Paiute oral history, “There used to be a big old log house in Circleville, Utah, beside the road where it 
            curves near where the potato cellars are. Years ago, the white men at Circleville locked up in that house all the Indians who were living nearby and told them 
            they were going to cut their throats. They began doing this by taking them outside one at a time and cutting their throats.”

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The Black Hawk War is the name given to the approximately 150 skirmishes, raids, battles, etc. between the Mormons and Ute, Paiute, Apache, and Navajo between 
            1865 to 1872.

            As described above, Brigham’s extermination order of the Timpanogos tribe and the Circleville Massacre are just two examples of the violence that lead to the Black Hawk War. By 1865, Native Americans had endured 15 years of white encroachment and 10 years of reservation life. The Black Hawk War was led by Ute war chief Antonga Black Hawk. The war ended when federal troops intervened in 1872. Historians agree there was not one singular event that started the bloodshed – aside from Joseph Smith claiming to see angels and the Mormons coming to Utah.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>On April 8, 1865, Ute Chief Black Hawk and Chief Jake Arapeen attended a council meeting in Manti, Utah. The Mormons and white settlers expected the Utes had come to settle differences over 15 livestock that had been stolen. Instead, the Utes demanded restitution for Arapean’s father’s recent death to smallpox. The Utes believed the Mormons and white settlers were using supernatural means to kill Native Americans. Chief Black Hawk had his own grievances. Several of Black Hawk’s family were killed at Battle Creek in 1849. Several of his family were beheaded at Fort Utah in 1850. He also had family killed in the Bear River Massacre in 1863 (which did not involve Mormons), and the “Squaw Fight” Grass Valley massacre in 1865.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Black Hawk had personally experienced the settlers’ distrust and contempt for his people. He had been beaten for a supposed theft with a bucket; his family members had been shot, and their heads taken as trophies in the Fort Utah War. He had been forced to lead Mormon militia against his own people. He was not alone; other natives had badly suffered physical and emotional torment due to white settlers who were on their lands. The Ute Chief’s personal agony was due to his people becoming increasingly famished, sick, and their alarming death rate while being forced to live in the conditions of the reservations.

          <p>At the April 8, 1865, meeting Chief Arapeen set an arrow to his bow. A settler grabbed Arapeen by the hair and dragged him from his horse. Both sides pulled them

            [such as Willden Fort] and deserted dozens of settlements while hundreds of Mormon militiamen chased their illusive [sic] adversaries through the wilderness with 
            little success. Requests for a Federal troops went unheeded for eight years. Unable to distinguish differences between tribesmen, frustrated Mormons 
            indiscriminately killed Native Americans, including women and children.”

          <p>The relationship between Mormons and the U.S. government also had negative effects for Native Americans. In 1862, Congress reduced the amount of money spent on 
             Indian Office, by 92 percent from $60,000 a year to $5,000. Funding was reduced because the government believed Mormons were using Native Americans to attack
              settlers passing through the territory.

        <h2 className="headlinePadding">Aftermath</h2>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Black Hawk’s War was a disaster for the Native Americans. They were forced onto the reservations, dependent on corrupt government agents. These tribes were forced to give up their traditional way of life and left to fend in one of the least habitable parts of Utah. Disease, hopelessness, alcoholism, and poverty reduced Native American populations drastically. After the war, without the threat of Native American attacks, Mormons and other settlers expanded settlements. After all, as the Mormons believed, God had given them the land.

          <p>What is the Mormon church’s position today on its past treatment of Native Americans? In the 2020 general conference Mormon apostle Quentin Cook stated, 
            “Many [non-Mormon] Missourians considered Native Americans a relentless enemy and wanted them removed from the land. In addition, many of the Missouri 
            settlers were slave owners and felt threatened by those who were opposed to slavery. In contrast, our doctrine respected the Native Americans, and our 
            desire was to teach them the gospel of Jesus Christ. With respect to slavery, our scriptures had made it clear that no man should be in bondage to another.”

          <p>But let me give credit where a “little” credit is due. In the church essay, American Indians, acknowledgements are made of the difficult relationship between the Utah Mormons and Native Americans. By design, the essay’s purpose is to give a brief overview. Sadly, however, there are no mentions made of particular Native American casualties or information on Mormons enslaving Native Americans. Read the church essay and compare it with the facts presented here.
