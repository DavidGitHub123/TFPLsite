          More than one century ago, in the April 1916 general conference,
          Mormon apostle James Talmage stated, “Yea, let God be true ... The
          (Lost Ten) Tribes shall come (to Zion) … they shall be brought forth
          as hath been predicted; and I say unto you there are those now living
          – aye, some here present – who shall live to read the records of the
          Lost Tribes of Israel … and those records … shall tell of the visit of
          the resurrected Christ to them, after He had manifested Himself to the
          Nephites upon this continent.”

          In the Kirtland Temple, on April 3, 1836, Joseph Smith and Oliver
          Cowdery claimed that Moses appeared to them and restored the keys to
          bring about “the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth”
          and the “leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north.”

          An
          article of faith states, “We believe in the literal gathering of
          Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes.” 
          In the Book of
          Mormon, Christ speaks of how, after leaving the Nephites, he will go
          to preach to the Lost Ten Tribes. “Now I go ... to show myself unto
          the lost tribes of Israel, for they are not lost unto the Father.”

          The Ten Tribes were taken captive by the Assyrians in 721 BCE. These
          tribes never returned to Judah but mixed with other nations and lost
          their identity. However, in Mormonism, the myth persists that the Ten
          Tribes are gathered in one location and will be led to Zion in Jackson
          County in the last days prior to the Second Coming. Joseph Smith
          revealed that John the apostle from the New Testament is with them.
          Church historian John Whitmer recorded Joseph stating in June 1831,
          “The Spirit of the Lord fell upon Joseph in an unusual manner, and he
          prophesied that John the Revelator was then among the Ten Tribes of
          Israel ... to prepare them for their return.”

          King, and said that he was preparing that people to return, and
          further said there is a mighty host to us.”

          arrive in Jackson County, they shall, “… fall down and be crowned with
          glory, even in Zion, by the hands of the servants of the Lord, even

          So where are the Lost Ten Tribes now? Sixth Mormon prophet Joseph F.
          Smith taught, “The Ten Tribes were taken by force out of the land …
          Many of them mixed with the peoples among whom they were scattered. A
          large portion, however, departed in one body to the north, and

          “‘Relative to the waters rolling back to the North: If you take a
          vessel of water and swing it rapidly around your head, you won’t spill
          any. But if you stop the motion gradually, it will begin to pour out.
          Now, Brother Brown, at the present time this earth is rotating very
          rapidly. When this planet returns, it will make the earth that much
          heavier, and it will revolve slower, which will cause the waters to
          continue eastward rapidly.’”

          Then, Joseph discussed the City of Enoch. “Did the Prophet ever tell
          your grandfather about the City of Enoch being taken from the earth?”
          “Yes, he did. He said that Enoch and his people kept so faithfully the
          laws of the Lord that they were translated. Not only Enoch and his
          people, but the Great City wherein they dwelt. Grandfather asked the
          Prophet, ‘Brother Joseph where was the City of Enoch located?’”

          “The Prophet answered, ‘Where the Gulf of Mexico now is.’ And he said,
          ‘The time will come when the mariner will say there is no bottom to
          the Gulf of Mexico. When that great piece of land was taken from the
          earth, it created a vacuum to the extent that it started a current
          that is now known as the Gulf Stream.’

          “‘Then he [Joseph] added, ‘In consequence of this great portion being
          taken away, it naturally threw the earth out of balance. Now when it
          comes back, and also the planet on which the Lost Tribes are, the
          earth will receive its equilibrium and revolve as it naturally was in
          the very beginning.’

          “‘Then, Brother Brown, this will fulfill the saying of the Prophet
          Jeremiah, chapter 16:14-15, “Therefore a day cometh, saith the Lord,
          that it shall no more be said, The Lord liveth, that brought up the
          children of Israel from the land of the north, and from the lands
          whither he had driven them; and I will bring them again unto their
          land that I gave unto their fathers.” Also, the saying of the Prophet
          Nephi: And it shall come to pass that the Jews shall have the words of
          the Nephites, and the Nephites shall have the words of the Jews; and
          the Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the Lost Tribes of
          Israel shall have the words of the Nephites and the Jews.’”

          From these statements, Joseph taught that the Lost Ten Tribes are
          residing in space on a portion of Earth. As part of the events leading
          to the Second Coming, that portion of earth will be returned to this
          earth near the north pole. When the portion of earth comes in contact
          with the polar region, the heat created from entering the earth’s
          atmosphere will be so great it will melt the ice, and a great highway
          will emerge. Then, a resurrected Joseph Smith, along with John the
          Revelator, will lead the Lost Ten Tribes to Zion in Jackson County.

          We learn this from Oliver Cowdery in his patriarchal blessing to
          Joseph. “[Joseph Smith] will go forth toward the north, and by the
          power of his word shall the deep begin to give way: and the ice melt
          before the Sun. By the keys of the kingdom shall he lead Israel into
          the land of Zion, while the house of Jacob shouts in the dance and in
          the song.”

          Regarding the return of the Lost Ten Tribes, the church published in
          the Millennial Star in February 1841 quoting the Book of Revelation
          and then providing commentary. “Revelation 6:13 – And the stars of
          heaven shall fall unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her
          untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. “Response: How can
          the stars fall from heaven to the earth when they (as far as we know)
          are much larger than the earth? We are not here given to understand
          that all the stars will fall, or even many of them: but only as a fig
          tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken by the wind. The
          stars which will fall to the earth are fragments which have been
          broken off from the earth from time to time in the mighty convulsions
          of nature; some in the days of Enoch; some in the days of Peleg; some
          with the Ten Tribes; and some with the death of Christ. These must all
          be restored again at the time of the restitution of all things. This
          will restore the Ten Tribes of Israel.”

          Therefore, the Ten Tribes were taken into space as a portion of the
          Earth was broken off. When they return, that portion will touch down
          near the north pole just prior to the Second Coming. This event will
          create the heat necessary to melt the polar ice caps, and the Lost Ten
          Tribes will walk to Jackson County with Joseph Smith and John the
          Revelator. Regarding Joseph’s teaching that the Lost Ten Tribes reside
          on a portion of the earth in space, the Mormon apologists will say
          this is just Joseph theorizing. Maybe so. But he left many of his
          followers with the impression that this was true speaking as a
          prophet.
