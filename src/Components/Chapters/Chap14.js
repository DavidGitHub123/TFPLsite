    <h1 className='chapterHeading'>Chapter 14: Thy Kingdom Come</h1>

    <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In Mormonism, the Kingdom of God is a kingdom of exalted families sealed through priesthood. From the nucleus of this Earth, those husbands and wives sealed as gods and goddesses here will eventually spread kingdoms across universes. “They shall receive a fulness of kingdoms, thrones, principalities, powers, dominions, and all the fulness pertaining to the Godhead.”  But let’s start small with the Kingdom of God on our Earth.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Where did Joseph get his idea of building the Kingdom of God and establishing a physical Zion in Jackson County?  Perhaps it was in the New Testament where Christ declared in the Lord’s prayer, “Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”  The Christian world had no idea that for nearly 2,000 years by uttering the Lord’s Prayer, they were praying for the establishment of Joseph’s Kingdom of God.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In the New Testament Christ mentions the Kingdom of God on earth. John writes, “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”  Luke writes, “But rather seek ye the kingdom of God … Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”  John writes of Christ’s encounter with Pilate, “Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight … Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world.”  Mark writes, “And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!”  Matthew writes, “And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph claimed that as part of the restoration he received numerous keys from heaven giving him authority to build God’s kingdom. Those keys would be passed down to each successive prophet. Mormon apostle Heber Kimball stated, “He [Brigham] holds the keys of the kingdom of heaven, just as much as Peter, James, and John did after Jesus committed the keys to them on the mount, and said, ‘I give unto you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whomsoever you bless I will bless, and whomsoever you curse I will curse.’ Brigham’s keys unlock the door to the celestial kingdom, and you cannot get there but by through the prophets of the Mormons.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>As an aside, treasure seekers in upstate New York in the early 19th century believed they possessed keys which enabled them to locate buried treasures. Joseph’s mother Lucy Smith stated that her son, while traveling to Josiah Stowell’s property in 1825 made the journey “with a view of getting Joseph to assist him in digging for a silver mine . . . on account of having heard that he possessed certain keys, by which he could discern things invisible to the natural eye.”  
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Kingdom of God Established in Christ’s Day</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Mormon Apostle Orson Pratt stated in 1859, “… The kingdom of God was built up in the days of Christ … but most of the Jewish nation chose to reject the Gospel … they cast it from them, and were not willing to be governed by it; therefore, the kingdom of God, instead of being a concentrated government among Israel, existed in detached portions here and there … Hence the kingdom … was taken from them and transferred over into the hands of the Gentiles.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Then, according to Orson, the Kingdom of God disintegrated after the death of the apostles. “The isolated individuals and branches receiving the kingdom were scattered ... There came a falling away, so that the kingdom, which existed in a scattered and broken condition through the Gentile nations, began to lose all the power and blessings pertaining to it.” Orson states that “the gift of healing was no longer made manifest; the gift of prophecy no longer existed; and so complete and dreadful was the apostasy, that one might travel through the whole of the Eastern continent and not find a Prophet, or Apostle, or Revelator … every office and power and authority and gift characterizing the kingdom of God, or in the least resembling a theocracy, ceased from all the Gentile nations.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>According to Orson there were 17 centuries of misery without the Kingdom of God on the earth. (You can see this is leading to Joseph’s restoration.) “… the few Saints who remained … became so darkened in their minds, through the wickedness and apostasy which prevailed, that they were counted worthy only to be trodden under the feet of the Gentile nations. Hence the powers of the earth made war with all those branches that professed to be the kingdom of God, and they overcame and destroyed them from the earth, and the kingdom of God no longer existed … for something like seventeen centuries.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Orson casts the earthly governments of those 17 centuries in a dark, oppressive light. “Instead of a theocratical government, or one of Divine origin, you could behold nothing but empires, absolute and limited monarchies, kingdoms, principalities, dukedoms, republics, and heterogeneous masses of conflicting revolutionary elements, thrown together, as if by some fortuitous circumstances, fomenting, igniting, and belching forth the hot lava of destruction, swallowing up millions of unhappy beings, and overwhelming all countries with desolation, misery, and death.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>According to Orson, Christ did establish the Kingdom of God, a theocracy, when he visited the Nephites, which lasted for 200 years until it disintegrated. “We are informed by the sacred and Divine record, called the Book of Mormon, that the kingdom of God flourished to a greater extent here than in the Eastern world. On this Western hemisphere the kingdom of God was established by the personal appearance of our Lord and Savior after his resurrection. Twelve disciples were appointed on this land to administer the Gospel, laws, and institutions of that kingdom. They went forth preaching, prophesying, working miracles, receiving revelations, and administering with authority Divine laws … This was a theocracy indeed.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>According to Orson, the formation of the U.S. government was divinely directed to give people religious freedom so the true Kingdom of God could be established. “We believe, when our ancestors threw off the yoke of tyranny and oppression placed on them by the Government of England, that they were not only inspired in doing this, but the Lord had something in view to accomplish … In the Constitution, certain rights were guaranteed to the people.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>However, according to Orson, there was a better system of government – the Kingdom of God. “But with all its glory and greatness and perfection, it was only a steppingstone to a form of government infinitely greater and more perfect – a government founded upon Divine laws, with all its institutions, ordinances, and officers appointed by the God of heaven.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>According to Orson, this was the final time in the history of this earth that the Kingdom of God would be established. “The Almighty determined to assert his right and establish an everlasting kingdom upon the unalterable principles of eternal truth – a kingdom which could never be destroyed nor ever be shaken, though the heavens should pass away, and the worlds disappear with a universal crash. “The Lord now saw that there was one nation upon the earth where he could venture to begin the great work – where a theocracy could exist in an ecclesiastical form, being legally and lawfully entitled to all the rights and protection guaranteed in the great American Constitution, in common with all religious parties.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>But, according to Orson, God knew the U.S. government would not obey a prophet. “They would not suffer a Prophet of God to come into their midst and dictate the laws that should be adopted by the nation. They would show him the door ... They would very likely say, “We will not for a moment listen to him, though he may profess to be inspired, and to have received heavenly visions, and to have seen God, and talked with him face to face, as Moses, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Therefore, according to Orson, God’s kingdom was to be established outside U.S. government control – as a small stone cut out of a mountain without hands. “I expect the literal fulfillment of that prophecy relating to the Saints of the last days arising like a small stone unconnected with this image, and disunited from all forms of government, both civil and ecclesiastical. I look for such a kingdom to arise, with a separate form of government, and to continue, and prevail, and progress, until the dominion and the greatness of the dominion under the whole heavens shall be given to the Saints of the Most High.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Then, according to Orson, the whole earth shall be filled with saints of God. “Daniel said that the kingdom which was to be established in the last days never should be destroyed, nor left to other people, but should exist forever, and increase until the whole earth should be filled by the Saints of the Most High.” Once the Kingdom of God is established, according to Orson, the ancient kingdom will come down with Christ at his Second Coming. “Therefore, instead of the ancient Church (Christ’s day) overcoming the image, it was itself to be overcome by the image. History shows the sad fulfillment of these predictions. Therefore, the former-day kingdom was not the stone of the mountain. The ancient kingdom being overcome, fled to heaven, and the Priesthood was caught up to God and to his throne; and there the Saints are reserved in heaven until the coming of the Son of God to reign on the earth, according to the predictions of the Prophets.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Then, Orson refers to the establishment of the Mormon Kingdom and how Christ will merge it with the heavenly kingdom Christ will bring down with him at the Second Coming. “Then he will bring that kingdom which is in heaven with him. He has to set up a kingdom on earth preparatory to that which will come from heaven. This preparatory kingdom must be established on the earth ... It will be a kingdom increasing in greatness and power and glory on the earth for many years preparatory to the coming of the King with the heavenly kingdom, at which time both the heavenly and earthly will be united in one, under their great Head and Lawgiver.”
          </p>

        <h3>Kingdom of God in Joseph’s Revelations</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The establishment of the “Kingdom of God” was a major theme in Joseph’s revelations to the early Mormons of the 1830s. Joseph provided his church with the following revelations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“For the purpose of building up my church and kingdom on the earth, and to prepare my people for the time when I shall dwell with them, which is nigh at hand.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“That the kingdoms of this world may be constrained to acknowledge that the kingdom of Zion is in very deed the kingdom of our God and his Christ; therefore, let us become subject unto her laws.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“And the benefits shall be consecrated unto the inhabitants of Zion, and unto their generations, inasmuch as they become heirs according to the laws of the kingdom.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“Hearken, O ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“I am in your midst, and am your advocate with the Father; and it is his good will to give you the kingdom.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“Wherefore, gird up your loins and be prepared. Behold, the kingdom is yours, and the enemy shall not overcome.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“I will be merciful unto you, for I have given unto you the kingdom.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“Wherefore, go forth, crying with a loud voice, saying: The kingdom of heaven is at hand; crying: Hosanna! blessed be the name of the Most High God.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“Unto whom I have committed the keys of my kingdom, and a dispensation of the gospel for the last times … in the which I will gather together in one all things, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“… pray earnestly that peradventure my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may go with you, and preside in the midst of my people, and organize my kingdom upon the consecrated land, and establish the children of Zion.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap let him thrust in his sickle with his might … may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“And ye shall go forth baptizing with water, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“And we know that all men must repent and believe on the name of Jesus Christ … or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“And by giving heed and doing these things which ye have received, and which ye shall hereafter receive—and the kingdom is given you of the Father, and power to overcome all things which are not ordained of him.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“Which Twelve hold the keys to open up the authority of my kingdom upon the four corners of the earth, and after that to send my word to every creature.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“And again, verily I say unto thy brethren, Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams, their sins are forgiven them also, and they are accounted as equal with thee in holding the keys of this last kingdom” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“… thou art the man whom I have chosen to hold the keys of my kingdom … That thou mayest be my servant to unlock the door of the kingdom in all places.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Timeline of Revelations on Building the Kingdom and Second Coming</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>According to Joseph, his revelations were the actual words of Jesus Christ. In its official description of The Doctrine and Covenants the church says that it “is a book of scripture containing revelations from the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith.” And the Lord said to the Joseph, “This generation shall have my ‘word’ through you.”  Eyewitness to Joseph receiving several revelations, Zebedee Coltrin recalled that on one occasion a group of elders attempted to correct the grammar in a revelation. Joseph corrected them, saying that every word had been dictated by Jesus Christ.  
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Here are Joseph’s revelations in chronological order concerning the building of Zion. As we review this timeline, remember Joseph had revealed earlier, “… there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to do but what he will do it.”  There are two possible scenarios. Either God changed His mind about establishing Zion, or Joseph got it dramatically wrong – causing great suffering, starvation, spiritual despair, and even death – as the plans for building the Mormon Zion lay in smoldering ruins by 1838.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>And Joseph set a timeframe on these events. They were to culminate in the “generation” or lifetime of the early Mormons of the 1830s as stated in an 1832 revelation.  A generation is a 20- to 30-year-period. Therefore, the decade of the 1860s were the years to watch.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>March 1829 – Mankind destroyed by fire at second coming if they do not repent. “For a desolating scourge shall go forth among the inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to be poured out from time to time, if they repent not, until the earth is empty, and the inhabitants thereof are consumed away and utterly destroyed by the brightness of my coming.” 

          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>September 1830 – Zion to be built on the Missouri borders by the Lamanites. “And now, behold, I say unto you that it is not revealed, and no man knoweth where the city Zion shall be built, but it shall be given hereafter.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>September 1830 – Second Coming is “nigh” meaning a short distance. “For the hour is nigh and the day soon at hand when the earth is ripe; and all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I will burn them up.”

          </p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>December 1830 – The Lord will suddenly come to his temple. Temple never built. “I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God; wherefore, gird up your loins and I will suddenly come to my temple. Even so. Amen.

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>March 1831 – New Jerusalem will shine with glory and be a place of terror for the wicked. “…  it shall be called the New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety for the saints of the Most High God; And the glory of the Lord shall be there, and the terror of the Lord also shall be there, insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it, and it shall be called Zion.”

          <p>May 1831 – Heavens to be shaken, valleys exalted, and mountains made low. “… continue in steadfastness, looking forth for the heavens to be shaken, and the earth to tremble and to reel to and fro as a drunken man, and for the valleys to be exalted, and for the mountains to be made low … – and all this when the angel shall sound his trumpet.”

          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>August 1831 – The gospel must go forth into all the world from Jackson County. “For, verily, the sound must go forth from this place into all the world … the gospel must be preached unto every creature, with signs following them that believe. And behold the Son of Man cometh. Amen.”
