          <p>On 12 May 1844, 300 people attended a meeting of former First Presidency Counselor William Law’s Reformed Church, which 
            explicitly rejected Joseph’s plans for a Mormon theocracy.

            William had become disaffected with Mormonism over polygamy and many of Joseph’s other actions.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>According to Michael Quinn, “With good reason most council members (Council of Fifty) regarded Smith’s public statement as his literal intentions, both religious and 
            governmental. There was already a theocratic organization bound by capital (death) oaths. These fifty men acknowledged Smith as a monarch over a pan-religious kingdom 
            on earth in which they were princes. Publicly, Smith was seeking the nation’s highest office by constitutional means, but privately he recorded in a thinly veiled 
            reference to himself, an unidentified Vermonter’s endorsement of revolution. ‘This government was about to be overthrown,’ his diary reported of the Vermonter’s 
            prophecy, ‘and the Kingdom which Daniel spoke of was about to be established somewhere in the west and he thought Illinois.’”

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Quinn continues, “Within days of his prophecy, covertly dissenting members wondered if there were any limits to Smith’s theocratic designs.”  
          <a id="clickable3" className="footnote">3 </a>

            These dissenters ultimately decided there was only one way to stop Joseph’s plans to “revolutionize the whole world” to fulfill Daniel’s prophecy. Despite their death oaths, certain Council of Fifty members believed Joseph had gone too far, and word about the Council of Fifty leaked out.

        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>On 10 May 1844, William Law and other disaffected Mormons printed the Nauvoo Expositor. The newspaper referred to Joseph as “Nauvoo’s Self-Constituted Monarch” and called for the repeal of the Nauvoo charter. In the Expositor, Joseph was called upon to list his plural wives – even though anti-Mormon newspapers had published lists.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph knew several Council of Fifty members had betrayed him. To stop the Expositor from publishing his secret and treasonous designs as “King, Priest and Ruler 
            over Israel on Earth,” Joseph had the press destroyed. On 22 June 1844, Joseph told the “Clerk of the Kingdom,”  
            <a id="clickable4" className="footnote">4 </a>

            William Clayton, to burn the Council of Fifty records. Joseph did not want the Council of Fifty’s minutes falling into the hands of his enemies.

            Instead, Clayton buried the records. Joseph fled Nauvoo as he had fled Palmyra, Kirtland, and Jackson County. Accused of cowardice for leaving his people leaderless, Joseph returned to face trial at Carthage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>On the morning of June 27, to free himself, Joseph sent an order to Major General Jonathan Dunham to lead the Nauvoo Legion in a military attack on Carthage 
            “immediately” to free the prisoners. Dunham refused, knowing an attack by the Mormons would result, not only in the loss of life in Carthage, but that the people 
            of Illinois would lay siege on Nauvoo.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>About 5 p.m. on 27 June, 250 men approached the Jail. When the jailer informed Joseph, he said, “They have come to rescue me!”

            As men came up the stairs, Joseph shot a gun someone had sneaked inside the jail, wounding three men.

I afterwards understood that two or three were wounded by these discharges, two of whom, I am informed, died …”</Tooltip> 
            
            The church teaches Joseph died like a lamb to the slaughter, but this is not true!  After being shot, Joseph leapt out the second-floor window calling out, “O Lord my God. Is there no help for the widow’s son.” His last words were a Masonic oath. The King of the Mormon Kingdom of God, who would rule and reign under Christ’s soon to be Second Coming, was dead.

          <p>Sarah Scott wrote to her parents, “Joseph … prophesied on the stand a year ago last conference that he could not be killed within five years from that time; 
            that they could not kill him till the Temple would be completed, for that he had received an unconditional promise from the Almighty concerning his days …”

            Mormon apostle Erastus Snow, and Council of Fifty member, stated that the Mormons “supposed that our prophet was going to continue with us, to lead us on until

          <p>Intent on avenging Joseph’s death and punishing the members of the Council of Fifty who broke their oath of secrecy, on 22 February 1845, George Miller, Hosea 
            ut, and Charles Rich, all Danites, discussed “the manner to pursue to rid ourselves of traitors who are in our midst seeking our lives.”

            Five days later, William Clayton wrote, “During the evening some person or persons took Washington Peck and bedaubed him all over with privy dirt 
            [from an outhouse].” The Mormons called this an anointing. Clayton added, “This is one of those mean traitors who lurk about continually in our midst

          <p>In Nauvoo, Mormons sought out dissenters and enemies. William Pace wrote, armed with “knives from ten to fourteen inches long,” a dozen young men and adults, 
            holding the office of deacons, of the “Whistling and Whittling Brigade” pressed close to a dissenter or suspicious non-Mormon, and their “incessant whittling with 
            those large knives was enough to strike terror to the hearts of the victims and he got out of town as quick as his legs could carry him.”

          <p>Sensing danger for his opposition to Brigham, former Stake President of Nauvoo, William Marks, fled Nauvoo. Brigham observed that “Brother William Marks had

            William left Nauvoo after the “anointing” of Washington Peck. Brigham observed of the “Whistling and Whittling Brigade” that “at the corner of every block a 
            deacon is found attending to his duty” and “every part of the city is watched with the strictest care.”

            On 4 April 1845, at a meeting of the high priests of Nauvoo’s 5th Ward, bishops Edward Hunter, Benjamin Covey, and presiding elder Duncan McArthur, all agreed 
            that if certain Mormons did not reform “they would at once discover themselves in the hands of Aunt Peggy and take leave of absence.”

            All these events occurred just a few days before the April 1845 General Conference. On June 27, 1845, the anniversary of Joseph’s murder, the Quorum of the Twelve held a prayer circle calling for God’s vengeance on those who had shed the blood of the prophets. Six months later this prayer of vengeance (oath of vengeance) became part of the temple endowment.

          <p>Since April 1845 Jonathan Dunham, who had refused Joseph’s order to storm Carthage and free him, had been on a mission to the 
            native Americans. Some Mormons called Jonathan a traitor for not defending Joseph. In the summer of 1845, rumors had reached 
            Nauvoo that Dunham had been killed. The official church history records his death occurring on July 28, 1845. G.A. Seymour 
            Young recorded a different story. Since the martyrdom, Dunham “seemed to grieve over the matter” of not rescuing the prisoners 
            at Carthage. G.A. recorded that Dunham persuaded “a friendly Indian” (Mormon Lewis Dana) “to kill and bury him.”

          <p>In the fall of 1845, Mormon enforcers became more openly violent. On September 14, 1845, Hosea Stout recorded that Nauvoo police “had to flog” three men “who were not in good fellowship.” One of the three men, Increase Van Dusen, said that he “… was knocked down & with a big club. The act was justified by the Captain of the Police Hosea Stout who claimed the power of life and death & threatened in other words to take his [life].” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>A few months later, Stout wrote that during the Sunday meeting at the temple, he and policeman John Scott (another Danite) 
            threw a large stone at the head of a suspected spy “which came very near taking his life.”

            These incidents were occurring 
            at public meetings of the church during daylight hours. Two days after Nauvoo’s police flogged dissenters, enforcers like 
            Porter Rockwell began using deadly force against anti-Mormons. On 16 September 1845, in his capacity as a policeman, 
            Rockwell shot and killed several anti-Mormons, including Frank A. Worrell, one of the guards who had allowed the mob to 
            kill Joseph and Hyrum at Carthage Jail.

            principles of righteousness … but when we undertake … to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In February 1845, Brigham reconstituted the Council of Fifty. He served as the chairman until 12 February 1849. On that day,

            which we belong will become the kingdom of our God and his Christ, and brother Brigham Young will become president of the 
            United States. (Voices in the crowd responded, “Amen”) and I tell you he will be something more, but we do not now want to

            At the 11 March 1845 meeting, Brigham stated, about the citizens of the United States, “… [I] feel as Lyman Wight said let 
            the damned scoundrels be killed, let them be swept off from the earth, and then we can go and be baptized for them.” 
            Brigham continued, “The Gentiles have rejected the gospel ... This is the last call we will make to them, and if they don’t 
            listen to it, we will sweep them out of existence.” In one of the Council of Fifty’s March meetings, Brigham’s words were 
            summarized by a clerk, “… in regard to going beyond the Rocky Mountains, he don’t feel like it, it is so far to go there and 
            have to come back to kill off these cursed scoundrels.”

        <h2 className="headlinePadding">Brigham Seizes Control to Become Prophet and Church President</h2>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph was murdered in June 1844. In the absence of a prophet or president, Brigham and the Quorum of the Twelve 
            Apostles assumed leadership of the church in Nauvoo. In October 1847 in Winter Quarters, Brigham Young approached the 
            Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and recommended that he be appointed president of the church. Wilford Woodruff recorded his 
            uneasiness, “I thought it would require a revelation to change the order of that Quorum.”

            <Tooltip anchorSelect="#clickable40" className="footnote-size" clickable>Wilford Woodruff's Journal, entry for October Twelve, 1847.</Tooltip> 
            
            Wilford was right. There was no authorization in Joseph’s teachings or revelations for this administrative act. Other 
            apostles had misgivings as well. The Quorum of the Twelve had no authority to organize a separate First Presidency without 
            a written and canonized revelation by the church. Wilford recorded, “… met in council with the Twelve. Orson Pratt introduced 
            the subject of the standing and rights of the president and also the Quorum. Orson Pratt was followed by George Albert 
            Smith, Wilford Woodruff, and Amasa Lyman.”

          <p>T.B.H. Stenhouse, a former confidante of Brigham, identified Wilford and Orson as opposing the organization of the First 
            Presidency with Brigham as the President of the church.

            John Taylor and Parley Pratt were also in opposition, but not present for the consultations. Minutes of quorum meetings show that George Smith was the fifth dissenting apostle. Nonetheless, a relentless Brigham wore the resistance down and with no revelation, the Quorum of the Twelve organized a first presidency on 5 December 1847 with Brigham as the president of the church.

            Whereas Joseph would receive a clear revelation, and the matter was settled, from Brigham to the present day you see a pattern of indecision, and going back and forth, on church matters until they a decision is landed on.

        <h2 className="headlinePadding">No Revelation, Invent a Miracle</h2>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>At the December 5, 1847, meeting there is no contemporaneous record of any miracle happening. However, 13 years later, 
            Brigham mentioned a divine “miracle” that occurred that day.  In April 1860 Brigham claimed that at Orson Hyde’s house “… 
            the power came upon us, a shock that alarmed the neighborhood …”

            suggesting an earthquake signaled the divine approval that the Quorum of the Twelve to form a new First Presidency. (How do they know that this supposed earthquake wasn’t actually a sign of God’s disapproval?)
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Six months later, in October 1860, Orson Hyde expanded the narrative, affirming that the Twelve organized a First 
            Presidency because the voice of God declared, “Let my servant Brigham step forth and receive the full power of the 
            presiding priesthood in my church and kingdom.”

            <Tooltip anchorSelect="#clickable45" className="footnote-size" clickable>Orson Hyde, Journal of Discourses, October 7, 1860, vol. 8, p. 234.</Tooltip>  
  
            Hearing the voice of God?  In April 1860, Brigham failed to mention to the audience that he had heard a voice. By contrast, Wilford Woodruff later said he did not remember any particular manifestations at the time of the organization of the presidency. His recollection was that there was a general feeling that this was the right thing to do, which he stated in his diary. Additionally, the meeting minutes mentioned nothing extraordinary such as the miracle of an earthquake or hearing God’s voice. Also, there is nothing in the historical record of Orson Hyde’s neighbors or acquaintances remembering the earthquake.

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>This is another example of retroactively creating false history to support Mormon claims of authority. This is similar to Joseph and Oliver Cowdery retroactively claiming in 1834, that John the Baptist, along with Peter, James, and John to restore priesthood to them in 1829. Then in 1834, when making the announcement that they had priesthood and received it in 1829, people were confused as to why they had never mentioned it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Additionally, Joseph claimed the Lord revealed in “words” with meaning, not the supposition of divine approval through such things as miracles such as earthquakes or a transfiguration that you are supposed to guess God’s will. The Lord was very clear with his words with Joseph! And it’s been demonstrated that the transfiguration of Brigham in Nauvoo never happened. And an earthquake as a sign of divine authorization to create a first presidency to elevate Brigham to the church president never happened either.
