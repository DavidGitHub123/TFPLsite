    <h1 className='chapterHeading'>Chapter 11: Joseph’s Inspiration from the Book of Revelation</h1>

    <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>According to Joseph Smith, Christ organized this work around five major themes. Many of these themes are found in the Book of Revelation. First, the Mormon gospel must be restored, an ensign of Zion be erected, and the vision of the Kingdom of God must be unfolded to humankind. Second, the Mormon gospel must be taught to the world and the honest in heart who receive it are sealed up to eternal life through temple ordinances and gathered to Zion in Jackson County. Third, the faithful must be sanctified and given an endowment of glory that there might indeed be a cloud and smoke by day and a pillar of fire by night over every dwelling place in Mount Zion. Fourth, the judgments of God must be poured out upon those who fight against Zion, to cleanse the earth of wickedness. Fifth, the earth must be renewed to a paradisiacal state of glory by the coming of Christ in glory, and Christ establishes the Kingdom of God for his Millennial reign.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Regarding the signs of the times, Joseph stated, “I will prophesy that the signs of the coming of the Son of Man are already commenced … We shall soon have war and bloodshed. The moon will be turned into blood … the Son of Man is nigh, even at your doors. If our souls and our bodies are not looking forth for the coming of the Son of Man … we shall be among those who are calling for the rocks to fall upon them.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>As a latter-day movement, Joseph and the early Mormons were fascinated by the symbolism of the Book of Revelation and its prophecies of the end times. Joseph stated, “… the Book of Revelation is one of the plainest books God ever caused to be written.”  He had much to say about John’s vision on the Isle of Patmos and how it unfolded latter-day events leading to Christ’s triumphal return – and his Millennial reign where the lion shall lay down with the lamb and humanity will experience a peaceful existence.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The early Mormons eagerly anticipated the great Millennial day when pain and heartache, hunger and suffering, and all the woes of humankind would evaporate from the human experience like icy snow in the warmth of sunlight. Isaiah said the future Millennial day, “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.”  And spoke of a day when there would be war no longer, “And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The early Mormons longed for the fulfillment of biblical prophecies of the redemption of the earth to its eternal and sanctified state. The early Mormons published that the purpose of God is to “… bring about the Millennial glory, when ‘the earth shall yield its increase, resume its [paradisiacal] glory, and become as the garden of the Lord.’”  John likened the future redeemed earth to a sea of glass and fire, where the resurrected righteous will dwell in glory, clothed with immortality, and endowed with eternal life. By revelation, Joseph Smith wrote that the sea of glass represented “the earth, in its sanctified, immortal, and eternal state”  – the earth resurrected to a state of glory and power in eternity. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph taught the early Mormons that upon this celestialized earth, the righteous will receive an eternal inheritance. “Then shall he be crowned with the crown of his glory, to sit on the throne of his power to reign forever and ever.”  “Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>“The Revelation of Jesus Christ”</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The Book of Revelation begins, “The Revelation of Jesus Christ … to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass.”  Speaking of Christ’s return John continues, “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.”  Then John states that he, “… looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard … said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter. And immediately I was in the spirit: and behold, a throne was set in heaven ...” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>John sees 24 elders seated around a throne, clothed in white raiment, wearing gold crowns. “And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal … and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.”  Joseph revealed that the 24 elders were men who “had been faithful in the work of the ministry and were ... in the paradise of God.”  To the early Mormons, these 24 elders had gained their exaltation and were residing in the presence of God.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>John is Shown a Book</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Next, John sees a book containing the history of the earth. “And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book … with seven seals, and I saw a strong angel proclaiming … Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.”  Joseph Smith revealed that the sealed book contains “the revealed will, mysteries, and the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>John weeps when he sees the sealed book. But then, one of the 24 elders says, referencing Christ, “Weep not: behold, the Lion of the Tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.”  John then sees “in the midst of the throne … a Lamb as it had been slain,” who came and “took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.”  At this, the beasts and the elders fall down before the Lamb. A heavenly host sings, “Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God … and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.”  
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Seven Seals and Latter-Day Judgments</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Of the seven seals on the book, Joseph revealed, “The first seal contains the things of the first thousand years, and the second also of the second thousand years, and so on until the seventh.”  John sees the opening of the first six seals of the book. “And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, come and see.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Next, John sees the symbolism of four horses. For the first seal, he sees a white horse which “went forth conquering, and to conquer.” Then a red horse for the second seal with “power … given to … take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another.” For the third seal, a black horse with a pair of balances in his hand. Then a pale horse for the fourth seal, whose name “was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>When Christ opened the fifth seal, John “… saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God … And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long … dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?”  The sixth seal pertains to the destruction of the wicked at the end of the world. John states, “And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal … there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Then John sees stars falling, the heavens rolling together as a scroll, and mountains and islands moving out of their places. John states, the “… kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men … and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains” from their fear at Christ’s glory as he descends to the earth. They bid the mountains and rocks to fall on us “… and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Harvest</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In the New Testament, Christ gave the parable of the wheat and tares. “Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.”  This is known as the great harvest. It is the sum and substance of John’s vision described in the Book of Revelation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph Smith stated, “Our Savior is the Sower – the people are the world – the harvest is the end of the world – the reapers are the angels … The Son of Man is to send forth his angels ... The Son of Man will do as he ever has done from the beginning – send forth his angels. If the reapers do not come the wheat cannot be saved ... The angels have begun to be revealed, they shall bind up the testimony ... The wheat gathered into the barn; the tares left in the field to be burned.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>As part of the sixth seal, John sees this great harvest season. According to Joseph, John saw how the righteous will be gathered to Zion in Jackson County, and eventually Jerusalem. The wicked will be gathered and destroyed in plagues, natural disasters, and wars. The wicked who somehow survive and remain alive, will be burned in Christ’s glory at the Second Coming. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>144,000 Sent out to Gather and Seal the Wheat into Zion</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph Smith corrected Revelation 7 in his Joseph Smith Translation to read, “I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth ... And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God.” John states he, “heard him cry with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And the number of them who were sealed, were an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>This sealing of the 144,000 servants of God is a critical step in the culminating events of the last days. Final judgments were not to be poured out on the earth to destroy the wicked until the 144,000 had been sealed in their foreheads. John said of the 144,000 that “These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”  
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>“Q. What are we to understand by sealing the one hundred and forty-four thousand, out of all the tribes of Israel – twelve thousand out of every tribe? 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>A. We are to understand that those who are sealed are high priests, ordained unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for they are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, to bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>A. We are to understand that those who are sealed are high priests, ordained unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for they are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, to bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Joseph’s Idea of Sealing</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Is the sealing spoken of in the Book of Revelation where Joseph conceived of sealings? Joseph stated, “I would advise all the Saints to go with their might and gather together all their living relatives to this place (Nauvoo), that they may be sealed and saved, that they may be prepared against the day that the destroying angel goes forth.”  At another time, Joseph stated, “How shall God come to the rescue of this generation? He will send Elijah the prophet.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>The term sealed up to eternal life is greatly misunderstood among Mormons today. The church today teaches that being “sealed up to eternal life” means that a man and women, and their children, are joined together for eternity through a temple ceremony. The sealing is a promise made between the couple and God, and it ensures that their relationship will continue after death if they remain faithful to their commitments.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>However, Joseph had something greater in mind. Being sealed up to eternal life is to reach such a high level of righteousness that you are guaranteed eternal life. Many Mormons today mistakenly assume they will be eternal families by living worthy to hold a temple recommend. But honestly, most Mormons today are not living the type of lives that warrant this according to Joseph Smith. The church does not encourage the level of righteousness or transformation required to meet Joseph’s level of commitment to receive more light and intelligence until you reach a perfect day and become a God with priesthood power to create universes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Brigham related the following dream where he says to Joseph, “The brethren have a great anxiety to understand the Law of Adoption or sealing principles … Joseph … said, ‘…tell the people to keep the Spirit of the Lord; and if they will, they will find themselves just as they were organized by our Father in Heaven before they came into the world. Our Father in heaven organized the human family, but they are all disorganized and in great confusion.’ Joseph then shewed me the pattern, how they were in the beginning. … [I] saw where the Priesthood had been taken from the earth and how it must be joined together, so that there would be a perfect chain from Father Adam to his latest posterity.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph gave important insights into the 144,000 and their place in Zion. He explained that the act of sealing them in their foreheads signifies “sealing the blessings upon their heads, meaning the everlasting covenant, thereby making their calling and election sure.”  Joseph revealed, “The more sure word of prophecy means a man’s knowing that he is sealed up unto eternal life, by revelation and the spirit of prophecy, through the power of the Holy Priesthood.”  Joseph also revealed, “For I am the Lord thy God, and will be with thee even unto the end of the world, and through all eternity; for verily I seal upon you your exaltation and prepare a throne for you in the kingdom of my Father.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>It is imperative that the righteous be given the opportunity to be sealed, to have their calling and elections made sure. If this does not take place the earth is cursed. Joseph revealed, “I will give you a quotation from one of the prophets, who had his eye fixed on the restoration of the priesthood, the glories to be revealed in the last days … Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Therefore, before the final judgments can be poured out, the elect of God must be sanctified and sealed, that they might be endowed with glory and be prepared for the coming of Christ. Joseph revealed, “The angel ascending from the east is he to whom is given the seal of the living God over the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore, he crieth unto the four angels having the everlasting gospel, saying: Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>As Zion increases in glory and might, the 144,000 will be sent throughout the darkening world to gather the righteous to Jackson County. They will perform sealings and second anointing ordinances as part of their mission to ensure people’s callings and elections are made sure. The glory of God will rest upon them as they venture forth to unknown parts in a world drenched in debauchery and sin searching for the good and noble people of the earth.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Isaiah prophesied they would be beautiful. “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings … that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth … for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.”  John the Revelator beheld the fruits of their harvest, “I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Identities of the Five Angels in the Book of Revelation</h3>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph revealed the four angels are “… they who have the everlasting gospel to commit to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; having power to shut up the heavens, to seal up unto life, or to cast down to the regions of darkness.”  Joseph identified the four angels as priesthood authorities from past dispensations, including Moses, Noah, Elijah, and Peter. Moses conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the keys of the gathering of the House of Israel from the four quarters of the earth, and the leading of the Ten Tribes from the land of the north.  Elias, or Noah, conferred the keys of Abraham, that in Abraham’s posterity all the kindreds of the earth will be blessed. Elijah conferred the keys of turning the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse. Into Peter’s hands was committed the everlasting gospel to preach to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>After these four angels have completed their missions of sealing up the righteous to eternal life, they will begin the work of administering the final judgments of God upon the wicked who make war against Zion. John the Revelator saw that eventually the four angels would be joined by a fifth, sixth, and seventh angel to complete the work of harvest.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph Smith identified the fifth angel from the east as John, the author of the Book of Revelation. Joseph revealed, “The angel ascending from the east is he to whom is given the seal of the living God over the twelve tribes of Israel. And, if you will receive it, this is Elias, which was to come to gather together the tribes of Israel and restore all things.”  Therefore, the work of the fifth angel is gathering the elect to Zion. His work must be accomplished before the final judgments can be poured out upon the wicked. This is why the fifth angel will cry out to the first four angels, “Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>Joseph surmised that John is the fifth angel from an appointment John received from the seventh angel of the harvest. Of his appointment, John wrote, “I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven … his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire; and he had in his hand a little book open … and cried with a loud voice … And the voice … said, ‘Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.’ And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, ‘Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.’”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>John reports that he took the book out of the angel’s hand and ate it up. “…it was in my mouth sweet as honey; and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, ‘Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.’”  In response to the question, “What are we to do understand by the little book which was eaten by John,” Joseph revealed, “We are to understand that it was a mission, and an ordinance, for him to gather the tribes of Israel; behold, this is Elias, who, as it is written, must come and restore all things.” 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>In gathering the House of Israel and placing “the seal of the living God” upon them during the great harvest season, John’s mission will be that of an Elias – he whom the Lord sends to prepare the way for “the greater revelation of God.”  John was told that when he received his appointment, “Thou must prophecy again before many people, and nations, and tongues, and kings.”  Therefore, John is an Elias, a restorer. Joseph revealed, at the coming of the Ten Tribes of Israel from the north country to Jackson County, John will go forth in their midst preparing the way before them, that they might come to Zion and be crowned with glory. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
          <p>John as the fifth angel will go forth with the 144,000 to the ends of the earth, in search of the elect of God, that all of the House of Israel might be sealed into the eternal family of God and be brought to Zion in Jackson County. Once the family of God has been sealed, the angels of the harvest will shift their focus to the destruction of the wicked. All this is necessary in preparing the way for the Millennial reign of Christ.
