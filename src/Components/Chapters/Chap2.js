          Is the Mormon church a church or a kingdom – the literal Kingdom of God on earth as Joseph Smith claimed?
          Mormon apostle D. Todd Christofferson referred to the church as the Kingdom of God. “The
          fulfillment of those prophecies and promises is now underway with the gathering of the covenant people into the Church, the kingdom of God
          on earth.”

          Christian churches do not claim to be the Kingdom of God. Rather, they
          anticipate Christ’s return to earth and the establishment of a
          Millennial Kingdom. However, Joseph Smith revealed in 1831, “The keys
          of the Kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from
          thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the
          stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth,

          Joseph and the early Mormons believed that they had established the
          Kingdom of God in their day. Yet today the church teaches that the
          Kingdom of God is a concept that will come to pass in the future. “The
          kingdom of God means the government of God ... But that principle will
          not be fulfilled … until, as we are told in the scriptures, the
          kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and his
          Christ, and he will rule over them, and when unto him every knee shall
          bow, and every tongue confess that he is Christ ... That time has not
          yet come.”

          logic behind that move goes back to the very beginning of the new

          The second anointing is a secretive temple ordinance never discussed

          The Mormon church teaches that there is a clear line of succession
          from Joseph Smith to each subsequent Mormon prophet – a continuing
          chain of priesthood authority and keys. Each successor holds the same
          priesthood keys to administer the affairs of the Kingdom of God.
          Joseph taught, “The keys (of the priesthood) have to be brought from
          heaven whenever the Gospel is sent.”

          The keys necessary for governing

          heavenly beings – for instance, John the Baptist, Peter, James, John,
          Moses, Elias, and Elijah.

          John Taylor, for which we have documentary evidence? Were the other

      <h2 className="headlinePadding" >The Prophecy that Started it All</h2>
      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          In the Old Testament, Daniel, a noble Jewish youth, is taken captive
          into Babylon around 605 BCE. Although faithful to the God of Israel,
          Daniel serves the Babylonian King as a slave in the King’s court.
          Then, one day, through his prophetic gifts, Daniel interpreted the
          meaning of the King’s dream.
          <a id="clickable23" className="footnote">23  </a>
          <Tooltip anchorSelect="#clickable23" className="footnote-size" clickable>Daniel 2:19.</Tooltip>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          According to Daniel’s interpretation, the dream foretells future world
          history and the eventual establishment of the Kingdom of the God of
          Israel that will rule over all political kingdoms – an interesting
          story coming from a people just brought into bondage by the
          Babylonians. Daniel saw an image of a man with “head of fine gold, and
          breast and arms of silver, and belly and thighs of brass, and legs of
          iron, and feet of iron and clay.” Then, a small stone cut out of a
          mountain without hands begins to roll. Gaining momentum, it strikes
          the image of the man breaking it to pieces. Then the stone becomes a
          great mountain and fills the entire earth.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          Daniel’s prophecy about the establishment of Israel’s Kingdom of God
          has figured prominently in Mormon theology. Joseph Smith and other
          leaders have taught that the rise of the Mormon church was the
          fulfillment of Daniel’s prophecy. For nearly 170 years, up until the
          2000s, the Mormon church had set itself up, as an “ensign to all
          nations” of truth restored that will gather in the elect of the earth,
          and usher in the Second Coming and Millennium reign of Christ.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="paragraph">
        <p>
          But in the Mormon church, where has the Kingdom of God rhetoric been
          for the last 25 years? 
          <a id="clickable24" className="footnote">24  </a>
          <Tooltip anchorSelect="#clickable24" className="footnote-size" clickable>Mormon Apostle Neal Anderson made passing mention to Daniel’s prophecy and how the Mormon church is the literal kingdom of God in the October 2016 general conference. “The God of heaven,” Daniel said, “[shall] set up a kingdom, [a stone cut out without hands, that will become a great mountain and fill the whole earth,] never [to] be destroyed … [but to] stand for ever … From the miraculous intervention of God to Daniel came the prophesied future of the gospel of Jesus Christ being restored to the earth, a kingdom that would fill the whole earth, ‘never [to] be destroyed … [but to] stand for ever.’ The number of members of the Church in the latter days would be relatively few, as Nephi prophesied, but they would be upon all the face of the earth.”</Tooltip>

          Why the radio silence? Perhaps declining church
          membership (less than four million attending Mormons) indicates a
          shrinking kingdom, not one that will fill all the earth and to which
          all nations will bow.

          which Daniel saw; and this kingdom Joseph Smith was sent by the
          Almighty to establish, with its priesthood and authorities; and we
          shall prosper exceedingly, if we cleave to it.”

          Third Mormon prophet John Taylor stated in 1858, “God has set his hand
          to work to accomplish his purposes, to gather together his people, to
          establish the principles of righteousness among men, and overthrow the
          kingdom of darkness, and establish his kingdom, and afford protection
          to the honest in heart among all nations, to introduce a reign of
          righteousness that shall ultimately prevail over the world.”

            In 1976, twelfth Mormon prophet Spencer Kimball spoke of Daniel’s
            prophecy. “Cyrus the great, with his Medes and Persians, would be
            replaced by the Greek or Macedonian kingdom under Philip and
            Alexander; and that world power would be replaced by the Roman
            Empire; and Rome would be replaced by a group of nations of Europe
            represented by the toes of the image.”

        <div className="paragraph">
          <p>
            Spencer Kimball then quotes Daniel, “Then shall the God of heaven set up a
            kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not
            be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume
            all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.”

            In that talk
            Spencer Kimball quotes a revelation to Joseph Smith, “And even so I have
            sent mine everlasting covenant into the world … to be a standard for
            my people … Wherefore, come ye unto it.” 
            <a id="clickable33" className="footnote">33  </a>
            <Tooltip anchorSelect="#clickable33" className="footnote-size" clickable>D&C 45:1-3, 9, 10.</Tooltip>
            
            Then Spencer Kimball goes on to
            refer to this standard. “This is the kingdom of God upon the earth,
            for it is Jesus Christ who organized this kingdom.”

        </div>

        <div className="paragraph">
          <p>
            Continuing, Spencer Kimball gave an outline of the restoration of the Mormon
            gospel. He spoke of how after “numerous revelations from the divine
            source” were given in 1830, the kingdom was “set up by the God of
            heaven, that would never be destroyed nor superseded, and the stone
            cut out of the mountain without hands that would become a great
            mountain and would fill the whole earth.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="paragraph">
          <p>
            According to Spencer Kimball, the Mormon church would be the standard to
            which “the honest in heart might be looking forward.” Recalling
            Joseph Smith’s claim as restorer, Spencer Kimball added, “It came about in a
            regular, normal process. An inspired, fourteen-year-old boy … [i]n a
            dense grove of trees sought the Lord and prayed for wisdom.” The
            time had arrived “and though the adversary, Satan, recognizing all
            the powers of eternity which would be revealed with the gospel, did
            everything in his power to destroy the lad and destroy the prospects
            of the Restoration.”

        <div className="paragraph">
          <p>
            To establish the Mormons’ claims to divine authority to erect and
            then carry forth the “standard” Kimball continued, “In quick
            succession there came other visitors. Peter, James, and John – men
            who last held the keys of the kingdom, the power of the priesthood,
            and the blessings of eternity – appeared … and restored … power and
            authority. John the Baptist … returned to the earth and laid hands
            on the Prophet Joseph to give him the Aaronic Priesthood. The great
            Moses of antiquity returned to the earth … Elijah, the prophet …
            returned to make way and prepare for the great temple work … Moroni
            appeared … and spent long hours explaining the peopling of the
            American continents by the Lehites and also the Book of Mormon … the
            gospel was revealed, line upon line and precept upon precept, and
            truths were restored, and power was given and authority was
            revealed, and gradually enough light and enough people were there
            for the organization of this kingdom of God which Daniel saw two and
            a half millennia ago.”

            Up until the 2000s, a chorus of Mormon
            leaders claimed the Mormon church was the literal fulfillment of
            Daniel’s prophecy. Apostle Bruce McConkie published in the late
            1980s in his book Mormon Doctrine, “The Church of Jesus Christ of
            Latter-day Saints as it is now constituted is the kingdom of God on
            earth … The kingdom is here, and it is the same kingdom which Daniel
            said would be set up in the last days.”

            In 1988, Prophet Ezra Benson
            stated, “I testify that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
            Saints is the kingdom which Daniel prophesied God would set up in
            the latter days, never to be destroyed, a stone that would
            eventually fill the whole earth and stand forever.”

            In 1999, Prophet Gordon Hinckley, stated concerning the
            establishment of Mormonism, “After centuries of darkness and pain
            and struggle, the time was ripe for the restoration of the gospel
            ... The Almighty Judge of the nations, the Living God, determined
            that the times of which the prophets had spoken had arrived. Daniel
            had foreseen a stone which was cut out of the mountain without
            hands, and which became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
            ‘And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
            kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not
            be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume
            all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever (Dan. 2:44).’”

            By 1844, Joseph had instilled in his followers an inspiring vision
            of the Mormon church as the nascent catalyst that would grow in
            power and might in the last days. He had his followers believing
            that they were called and ordained from the foundation of the world
            to play mighty and powerful roles of leadership as members of the
            House of Israel where they would rule over the world as Saviors on
            Mount Zion. This vision extended through the church until the 2000s.

        <div className="paragraph">
          <p>
            But what if the biblical figure Daniel never existed? This would
            prove that this prophecy is false and a death blow to Mormonism. The
            fact of the matter is that scholars don’t believe Daniel existed.
            There is no extra-biblical evidence to support the view that Daniel
            was a real person. Scholars believe Daniel’s “prophecy” was the work
            of a later scribe from 2nd century BCE under the rule of the Greek
            king Antiochus IV Epiphanes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="paragraph">
          <p>
            If Daniel had been a real person from 6th century BCE, scholars
            question why his account contained so many errors. For example, the
            Book of Daniel gives the wrong date for Daniel’s incarceration in
            Nebuchadnezzar’s court according to historical evidence for the time
            period. He also miscalls Nebuchadnezzar “king” when at that time he
            was a prince.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="paragraph">
          <p>
            In chapter 4, Daniel gives an account of Nebuchadnezzar losing his
            mind for a period of time in which he lives, sleeps, and eats in the
            field with the cattle. No such episode is recorded in history. In
            Chapter 5, Daniel refers to Belshazzar as king and as being
            Nebuchadnezzar son, even though it’s known elsewhere that Belshazzar
            was never king and wasn’t related to Nebuchadnezzar. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="paragraph">
          <p>
            In ChapterS
            5, Daniel says that Belshazzar is killed in a violent action when
            Darius the Mede conquers Babylon. But it was Cyrus, a Persian, who
            conquered Babylon, and he did so bloodlessly. There are also no
            historical records of the figure of Darius the Mede. For these and
            other reasons, these errors point to a 2nd century BCE author.

        </div>

        <div className="paragraph">
          <p>
            In a time of few written records, it is hard to believe that someone
            who was allegedly an official in the administration of the very
            people he wrote about would do so. All the evidence, for what it’s
            worth, points to Daniel being a fictitious character. Therefore, if
            Daniel was not an historical person, there was no dream from God to
            interpret. There was no stone rolling down the mountain. No Kingdom
            of God for Joseph Smith to restore and build? But let’s move on from
            Daniel’s prophecy to the structure of the Mormon Kingdom in the last
            days.
